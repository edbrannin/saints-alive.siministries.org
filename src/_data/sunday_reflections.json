He made him ruler over all the Israelites. He bestowed on him the gifts of music and poetry (many of our psalms are attributed to King David). Most importantly, he promised that the Messiah would be of David&apos;s stock. Thus Jesus was &quot;of the house and lineage of David&quot;.</p>\n<p>For all his strengths, David had his weaknesses. Power can be abused and David abused it. His most notorious offense was to steal Bathsheba from her husband, General Uriah, and then to &quot;cover up&quot; the adultery by arranging for him to be &quot;accidentally&quot; slain in battle. Truly, the mighty King had fallen low!</p>\n<p>But even though he had committed this gross double sin, David still remained a sincere person. So when the prophet Nathan, speaking in the name of God, rebuked him for his crimes, he brought him to his senses. As today&apos;s first reading records it, David exclaimed, &quot;I have sinned against the Lord!&quot; And he really was sorry. When Nathan saw his remorse, he reassured him of God&apos;s grace. God had forgiven his sin and would not condemn him to death. But David would still have to pay a severe penalty for his offenses, even though they were forgiven. David did not balk. He knew he had it coming to him!</p>\n<p>In 1983 the church observed a special Holy Year in commemoration of the 1950th anniversary of our Redemption through Christ&apos;s death. Pope John Paul called on us to repent of our sins and to confess them privately to our priests - the present day &quot;Nathans&quot; - so that we may receive their assurance, &quot;The Lord on his part has forgiven your sins.&quot;</p>\n<p>If were are to confess our sins completely and humbly, we must first of all admit that we are sinners. Otherwise, we may try to excuse rather than accuse ourselves. Therefore, may we who share David&apos;s frailty also share his honesty and be able to say with him to God, &quot;I acknowledged my sin to you.

Rather, they show the critical part that sincere repentance and acknowledgement of guilt play in our relationship with God.</p>\n<p>David is the great example of a sincerely repentant person. He realized that not even Kings are exempt from punishment and death in the eyes of the Lord. Psalm 51, the &#x201C;Miserere,&#x201D; is usually attributed to his authorship. It reflects the heart of a man who knows he is guilty, yet is truly repentant and begging for mercy from Almighty God. We hear from the Prophet Nathan in the First Reading that this repentance and trust in God&apos;s mercy were answered.</p>\n<p>The Gospel (Luke 7:36-50) also tells a story of a repentant woman. By her weeping, one knows that she recognizes her guilt, and trusts in God&apos;s mercy as she kneels at the feet of Jesus. The beautiful part is that Jesus forgives her &#x201C;for her many sins,&#x201D; even though she did not verbalize such a request. Her actions spoke louder than words.</p>\n<p>God&apos;s mercy is unlimited, and available to all. Even murder (including abortion) and adultery are not outside the realm of God&apos;s forgiveness! All we need to do is acknowledge our sins, sincerely repent and confess these wrongdoings (whatever they are), and trust in God&apos;s mercy. His answer is always simple, like it was for the woman in the story: &#x201C;Your sins are forgiven. Your faith [in my mercy] has been your salvation. Go now in peace.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>St. Paul reminds us in the 2nd Reading (Galatians 2:16,19-21) that we are not &#x201C;justified&#x201D; (made right with God) by the Law. Instead, it is faith in the mercy of Jesus, the Son of God.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Jesus was a &#x201C;scandal&#x201D; to the Jewish religious leaders, because they did not understand that his mission was to call sinners to repentance (CCC #588).

Just the title alone can explode your imagination and take you down the sordid pathways of life. The &#x201C;Lady&#x201D; throws her come-hither glances at everyone, and never turns down liquid refreshment. But when we get to the beautiful last line of the song, we are delighted to find out she is only a nine-day old baby girl.</p>\n<p>Today&#x2019;s Gospel (Luke 7:36-50) starts out in a similar fashion. A lady we presume to be a naughty lady comes in and starts kissing the feet of Jesus, and anoints them with expensive perfume and her tears. We think, &#x201C;oh-oh, there&#x2019;s going to be trouble.&#x201D; Simon the Pharisee&#x2019;s motivation is already questionable, because he had not even extended normal hospitality to Jesus when he entered the house. Here was his opportunity to prove to everyone that Jesus wasn&#x2019;t a prophet. After all, If Jesus was a prophet, Simon reasoned, he would have known about the woman and surely would have prevented her from anointing his feet.</p>\n<p>But Jesus immediately turns our attention (and Simon&#x2019;s) to the subject of monetary debts that are forgiven and the attitudes of grateful hearts. The message is clear: if you are forgiven a lot, you will love a lot. Obviously the woman that the Pharisees thought was a &#x201C;shady lady&#x201D; had already acknowledged her sins before God, and knew in her heart that she had been forgiven. So she poured out her expression of gratitude and love by washing the feet of Jesus. Her heart and soul were as clean as that nine-day old baby girl in the song! The last line of today&#x2019;s gospel song is one of perfect beauty.</p>\n<p>It is a powerful double message for us to ponder today. If we do not have unconditional forgiveness in our hearts, and express it, then we do not have love. If we do not acknowledge our own sinfulness and seek forgiveness, we will be unable to love unconditionally. Jesus told the woman to &#x201C;go in peace.&#x201D; Is there peace in my heart? If not, what must I do about that?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>The prayer from a penitent heart is always answered by Jesus.

Our whole voyage through life is a test of our faith. We say that we believe in Jesus. But when times turn tough, how do we react?

First, let&#x2019;s look at suffering Job. We are told in Chapter 1 of the Book of Job that &#x201C;innocent&#x201D; Job suffers incredible losses of family, possessions, and health. He is afflicted with severe maladies and endures extreme pain and isolation from community. He never complains against God; nevertheless, despite his grave misfortunes, God remains silent for thirty-six chapters! Job&#x2019;s attitude is one of &#x201C;Why me, God?&#x201D; But in spite of his pain and desolation, while he sought God he always remained faithful to God. When God finally does answer &#x201C;out of the storm,&#x201D; it is to remind Job of the reality of the Creator-created relationship, and the necessity of fidelity and trust in God who is always present.</p>\n<p>In the Gospel, a similar situation is at hand.

The parallel with the &#x201C;silence&#x201D; of God during the suffering of Job is clear.</p>\n<p>In the story of Job, because he trusted even in the midst of his suffering, he received a blessing in the form of restored health, new possessions, a larger family, and a long life. In the story of the apostles caught in a storm at sea, they were not as trusting. Jesus recognized their lack of faith, but because of their petition still gave them a blessing by calming the seas.</p>\n<p>Jesus also had his &#x201C;time of silence,&#x201D; waiting for God to act. Sometimes the blessing will be after death, as it was for Jesus &#x2013; his ultimate blessing came three days after his crucifixion. The lesson: trust always that God is present, even though he &#x201C;seems&#x201D; to be silent. Your trust and faithfulness will be rewarded with blessing, at a time deemed by God as perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>We are called to be faithful, accepting all that comes &#x2013; whether poverty or fortune. To persevere in the faith we must nourish it with Holy Scripture, and ask the Lord to increase our faith (CCC #162).</p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

History testifies to Peter&apos;s death on a cross - a cross set upside down in the earth because Peter felt he did not deserve to die in exactly the same way his Master had.</p>\n<p>In addition to a few historical evidences of St. Peter&apos;s death, there are also some purely legendary ones.

Albinus, a friend of Emperor Nero, urged Agrippa to seize and execute Peter as leader of the hated Christians. Xantippe, learning of the proposal, hastened to warn Peter. She and other leading Roman Christians urged him to escape from Rome.</p>\n<p>&quot;Shall we be put to flight, brother?&quot; Peter asked sternly. Was he to play the coward?</p>\n<p>&quot;No,&quot; they insisted, &quot;but that you maybe able still to serve the Lord.&quot; Peter thought awhile and saw their point, But he would not allow them to accompany him. &quot;Let no one of you depart with me, but I will go out alone, for I have changed my purpose.&quot;</p>\n<p>However, Peter had not got far outside Rome&apos;s Appian gate when he suddenly saw Jesus walking the Appian Way towards Rome.</p>\n<p>&quot;Lord,&quot; cried Peter, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; (Domine, quo vadis?)</p>\n<p>Jesus answered, &quot;I am going to Rome to be crucified.&quot; &quot;But, Lord,&quot; Peter replied, &quot;Were you not crucified once?&quot;</p>\n<p>The Master replied, &quot;I saw that you were fleeing from death, and I am willing to be crucified in your stead.&quot;</p>\n<p>Peter got the point. &quot;Lord, I will go. I will do your bidding.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Fear not,&quot; Jesus reassured him, &quot;for I am with you.&quot; Then He vanished. Peter returned to Rome, no longer confused or fearful, but joyful.

The religious leaders, the political leaders, and even his friends and family turned against him for preaching that prophetic message.

Korea was first evangelized by a Korean.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, certain Christian writings in Chinese began to find their way into nearby Korea. One prominent gentleman named Yi-Sung-Hun was attracted by what he read. In 1184, while visiting Peking, China, on a diplomatic mission, he sought out the Portuguese Catholic missionaries there. Receiving baptism from them he brought Christianity back home and spread the good news. When a Chinese Catholic priest finally visited Korea ten years later, he found 4,000 Korean Christians who owed their faith to Yi-Sung-Hun.\n\nBy the time French missionaries arrived in Korea in the 1830's to establish a formal mission, the number of Korean Catholics had already doubled.

McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q325: How do I “take up my cross” in this modern world, as Jesus desires (Mt 10:37-42), and what does that really mean today?**\n\nThis gospel usually makes me feel very “uncomfortable.” After all, the “cross” in this context is not something you wear as a decoration around your neck. No, Jesus was talking about something much more significant. As always, the Gospel is a continuing challenge to Catholics to live a meaningful Christian life – even during persecution.\n\nSo what is “meaningful”? Look at some of the descriptions Jesus uses. He is saying that our central focus must always be on Jesus, and nothing else. Jesus must be the center of our lives, even ahead of family bonds, and our lives must follow the pattern or way of His life.

That was the crucial criterion above all else. It even led to His death for our salvation, an unsurpassable gift!\n\nThat life of selflessness is what you and I are called to imitate. This is the foundational calling of every Christian. It may mean pain and persecution. It always calls for the obedience of faith, trust in a loving God, and humble acceptance of the teachings of the apostles and their successors, the Roman Catholic bishops.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The “first vocation” is always to follow Jesus.

It is that compassion that urges us to visit those who need consoling. And our compassion finds its release in being present to others in their time of need, just like Jesus. Consoling and comforting are spiritual works of mercy, and visiting the sick and dying is a corporal work of mercy. This &quot;mystery of mercy&quot; is supremely revealed in the life of Jesus, and as Pope John Paul II taught us, it is our constant mission to proclaim and introduce that mercy into our daily life (Dives in Misericordia, 1980; #14).</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Just being present to those in need is healing!

By his frontal attack on sickness and death in today&apos;s Gospel Jesus proclaims in dramatic deed that the Kingdom of God is at hand. He cures the woman&apos;s disease and eases her anxiety; he raises the girl from death and tells them to get her something to eat. What we have been given we should enjoy, but we need to remember that we hold all possessions in trust from God, to be used according to his purposes.

How about tomorrow at the latest?\n\nThis is what Jesus is getting at in today's gospel. We need to be absolutely sure about what we are getting into, when we join the Catholic bunch! We very rapidly discover that there are no \"not yet\" clauses in our covenant with God! It is all or nothing. Jesus wants to conquer our entire heart; are we ready to surrender, or do we still want to \"negotiate\" terms? Are we ready to follow his appointed bishops and magisterial teachings, or do we want to \"pick and choose\" what fits our life style?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Jesus gave us an example of total commitment to mission, \"setting his face\" to go to Jerusalem and guaranteed death that awaited (CCC #557). The response of faith to the invitation of Jesus is our consent and total commitment (CCC #1102).\n\n---\n\n**Come Follow Me**\n\nElisha sacrificed his oxen and answered the call to become Elijah's disciple.  The young man called by Jesus put a higher priority on other demands, good though they may have been.  St. Paul reminds us that we are free; we are not disciples of Law which only defines the minimum required.  We are free but we must learn how to use that freedom: the way of love, which never asks what is the least I have to do, but rather: What else can I do?\n\n_Lord, sometimes I take your call to discipleship too casually. Sure I want to follow you, but not just yet.  Later when I have all these other demands on me wrapped up, I'll get around to it but not just now.  Help me to understand that the call, whatever form it may take, must be answered today._",

He also has wonderful ways of getting us to accept that word without in the least interfering with our free will.</p>\n<p>Here is a remarkable story that proves both points.</p>\n<p>Father William Naughton was pastor of the church of SS. Peter and Paul, Elmira, New York, in the late 1940&apos;s. In 1946 he started a class for sixteen people who had asked to be instructed in the Catholic faith. To break the ice at their first meeting, he asked each of the sixteen to tell the rest what had prompted them to seek entrance into the Church.</p>\n<p>Most of those questioned probably gave interesting but not unusual reasons: they had been baptized Catholics but never raised as such; they had married Catholics, or planned to do so; and so forth.</p>\n<p>One woman, however, told a tale that startled everybody and opened up new vistas on God&apos;s ways of working.</p>\n<p>On a certain day, said this housewife, she heard a dog barking loud and long outside her house. Looking out the window to see what was happening, she saw that the dog was dragging somebody&apos;s coat along the ground. He would tug it a few feet, stop and bark, and then tug it a few feet farther.</p>\n<p>The housewife at once went out, snatched the coat away from the dog, and sent him packing: She took the garment indoors and began to inspect it. At this point it was soiled and rather badly ripped. Whose was it? She looked into the pockets for some identification of ownership. All she found was a Catholic prayerbook, and, this had no owner&apos;s name on it.</p>\n<p>But the prayerbook now caught her fancy. She started reading it, and went on until she had finished it. &quot;I had never thought of religion before,&quot; she told the instruction class. &quot;But after reading the book, I decided to attend some Catholic services. I liked what I saw, so here I am!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The seed that falls on good ground,&quot; says today&apos;s psalm response, &quot;will yield a fruitful harvest.&quot; This housewife was evidently &quot;good ground.&quot; But the way God sowed the seed of His word was certainly striking. As St. Gregory the Great would have said: &quot;It was not by chance but in God&apos;s providence.&quot; Who but a tender, even a playful God, would have thought of using a barking dog as a messenger of the Good News?</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q326: The point of the Readings today seems to be about the desirability of &#x201C;humility&#x201D; [Zech 9:9-10; Rom 8:9-13; Matt 11:25-30]. Is such &#x201C;meekness&#x201D; calling for a milk-toast attitude on our part?</strong></p>\n<p>The First Reading points out a contrast between the two favored kings of Israel: David and his son Solomon. David was powerful yet never owned a chariot; he was truly humble, and was totally dependent upon God. Solomon was powerful and intelligent, yet totally dependent upon his many chariots. In the Second Reading, St. Paul captures this contrast beautifully when he talks about dependence on the &#x201C;flesh&#x201D; without the &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; &#x2013; a dependence upon Self rather than upon God&#x2019;s assistance.</p>\n<p>If you have ever been to the Grand Canyon, you have probably taken a ride on the donkey from the rim of the canyon down to the canyon floor. That meek little donkey has only one purpose in life (as far as I know), and that is to help carry the burdens of others -- either You as a passenger, or to back-pack supplies for others. The message: why do it yourself, when you can have help with your burdens?</p>\n<p>This lesson we learn from the behavior of Jesus himself. He humbly accepted his situation in life, and always trusted totally in his heavenly Father. Jesus is saying the same thing in the Gospel: don&#x2019;t depend upon yourself, trust in Jesus to help carry your burdens. More importantly, learn to carry your own burdens with His yoke -- he is there to help you, to lighten your burden. That is what Humility is all about, learning to turn humbly to Jesus, acknowledge your need, and accept His help.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>The Word who was All-Powerful did not cling to his power, but became flesh, to offer his Yoke as our model of holiness (CCC #459). By his own poverty, he gives us the example to follow in our encounters with trials and burdens (CCC #520). We will never enter the kingdom without humility, because humility is the antidote to sinful Pride (CCC #2559).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Small is Beautiful</strong></p>\n<p>We Americans like to think big. As citizens of the most powerful nation on earth we sometimes think that we can use that power successfully in anything we put our minds to. Today&apos;s readings seem to contradict that assumption. Zechariah speaks to an Israel looking for a victorious messiah king coming with power to restore Israel&apos;s place among the nations.

    "markdown": "**\"Seed on good ground\"**\n\nGod has wonderful ways of communicating His word to us. He also has wonderful ways of getting us to accept that word without in the least interfering with our free will.\n\nHere is a remarkable story that proves both points.\n\nFather William Naughton was pastor of the church of SS. Peter and Paul, Elmira, New York, in the late 1940's. In 1946 he started a class for sixteen people who had asked to be instructed in the Catholic faith. To break the ice at their first meeting, he asked each of the sixteen to tell the rest what had prompted them to seek entrance into the Church.\n\nMost of those questioned probably gave interesting but not unusual reasons: they had been baptized Catholics but never raised as such; they had married Catholics, or planned to do so; and so forth.\n\nOne woman, however, told a tale that startled everybody and opened up new vistas on God's ways of working.\n\nOn a certain day, said this housewife, she heard a dog barking loud and long outside her house. Looking out the window to see what was happening, she saw that the dog was dragging somebody's coat along the ground. He would tug it a few feet, stop and bark, and then tug it a few feet farther.\n\nThe housewife at once went out, snatched the coat away from the dog, and sent him packing: She took the garment indoors and began to inspect it. At this point it was soiled and rather badly ripped. Whose was it? She looked into the pockets for some identification of ownership. All she found was a Catholic prayerbook, and, this had no owner's name on it.\n\nBut the prayerbook now caught her fancy. She started reading it, and went on until she had finished it. \"I had never thought of religion before,\" she told the instruction class. \"But after reading the book, I decided to attend some Catholic services. I liked what I saw, so here I am!\"\n\n\"The seed that falls on good ground,\" says today's psalm response, \"will yield a fruitful harvest.\" This housewife was evidently \"good ground.\" But the way God sowed the seed of His word was certainly striking. As St. Gregory the Great would have said: \"It was not by chance but in God's providence.\" Who but a tender, even a playful God, would have thought of using a barking dog as a messenger of the Good News?\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q326: The point of the Readings today seems to be about the desirability of “humility” \\[Zech 9:9-10; Rom 8:9-13; Matt 11:25-30\\]. Is such “meekness” calling for a milk-toast attitude on our part?**\n\nThe First Reading points out a contrast between the two favored kings of Israel: David and his son Solomon. David was powerful yet never owned a chariot; he was truly humble, and was totally dependent upon God. Solomon was powerful and intelligent, yet totally dependent upon his many chariots. In the Second Reading, St. Paul captures this contrast beautifully when he talks about dependence on the “flesh” without the “spirit” – a dependence upon Self rather than upon God’s assistance.\n\nIf you have ever been to the Grand Canyon, you have probably taken a ride on the donkey from the rim of the canyon down to the canyon floor. That meek little donkey has only one purpose in life (as far as I know), and that is to help carry the burdens of others -- either You as a passenger, or to back-pack supplies for others. The message: why do it yourself, when you can have help with your burdens?\n\nThis lesson we learn from the behavior of Jesus himself. He humbly accepted his situation in life, and always trusted totally in his heavenly Father. Jesus is saying the same thing in the Gospel: don’t depend upon yourself, trust in Jesus to help carry your burdens. More importantly, learn to carry your own burdens with His yoke -- he is there to help you, to lighten your burden. That is what Humility is all about, learning to turn humbly to Jesus, acknowledge your need, and accept His help.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The Word who was All-Powerful did not cling to his power, but became flesh, to offer his Yoke as our model of holiness (CCC #459). By his own poverty, he gives us the example to follow in our encounters with trials and burdens (CCC #520). We will never enter the kingdom without humility, because humility is the antidote to sinful Pride (CCC #2559).\n\n---\n\n**Small is Beautiful**\n\nWe Americans like to think big. As citizens of the most powerful nation on earth we sometimes think that we can use that power successfully in anything we put our minds to. Today's readings seem to contradict that assumption. Zechariah speaks to an Israel looking for a victorious messiah king coming with power to restore Israel's place among the nations. The prophet tells them to look instead for a king who will come not in a war chariot but humbly on a donkey. Today many people look to the media pundits and celebrities for wisdom and the answers to their problems, but Jesus tells us to look instead to the meek and the humble. If we would know God and the life he offers us, we must go to the son and those who imitate his humility.\n\n_Dear God, our Father,, I thank you and praise you for sending your Son to show us the way to live. I thank you for the many burdens you have lifted from me or at least gave me the courage to bear. May I so imitate the humility of Christ as to come to know you more fully._",

She ordered Juan, &quot;my little son,&quot; to tell the bishop of Mexico City that she wanted him to build a church dedicated to her patronage at the spot of her suburban apparition.</p>\n<p>Although he was doubtlessly timid about approaching a bishop, the Indian followed directions. Juan de Zumarraga, the Franciscan bishop of Mexico City, was a good man, but too prudent to accept any tale of apparitions without further investigation. When Juan returned to him twice more on Our Lady&apos;s insistence, the Bishop said he was unwilling to act unless the Lady gave him some sign that she was the Mother of God. Finally, on December 12, 1531, Mary greeted Juan once again and gave him not one but two signs for Bishop Zumarraga. She told the Aztec to go up the hill to a certain place and pick a bouquet of roses. Now, this was not the season for roses, and the patch, which he knew well, was usually tangle of weeds rather than a garden. Yet he now found it full of sweet and beautiful flowers. After he had cut them, Our Lady herself arranged them in the lap of his tilma, a sort of poncho worn as a cloak. He must hold the front edges of the cloak close to his shoulders, she said, so the roses would not fall; and he must keep it there until he was in the bishop&apos;s presence.</p>\n<p>Juan Diego set out for the city and was ushered again into the presence of Bishop Zumarraga. Kneeling, he told the bishop that he had brought this sign. Then he let fall the hem of the tilma. The roses dropped to the floor. But a second marvel appeared. On Juan Diego&apos;s cloak there was a colored picture of Mary just as he had seen her, a figure 56 inches high. At once, bishop Zumarraga and his companions fell to their knees. This was indeed a sign. The bishop obeyed Our Lady and built the shrine in her honor, installing over the altar the portrait that Juan Diego had brought him.</p>\n<p>The picture on the tilma has been an object not only of spiritual devotion but of a scientific interest second only to that shown to the Holy Shroud of Turin. Scientists have agreed not only that the coarsely woven burlap-like figure on the tilma should have long since decayed but also that the picture on it is not a painting. In 1951, one of the scientific investigators discovered something still more surprising. Using a magnifying glass, he discovered in the eye of the image the reflection of the face of a bearded man. The then Archbishop of Mexico City undertook a new investigation which discovered in both of the eyes three figures, not one. The main bearded figure corresponded with sixteenth century portraits of Juan Diego. The other two resembled Bishop Ranival, known to have been on hand February 12, 1531, and Juan Gonzalez, Bishop Zummarraga&apos;s interpreter. Now, reflections of bystanders do not appear in hand-painted eyes. They do appear in photographs. Was Mary herself in the room that day; and was the picture a kind of miraculous photo of herself and those present?</p>\n<p>However the image may have been impregnated on the cloak, the reflections of people in her eyes suggests that she &quot;had her eye&quot; on all of them. You and I may be unimportant &quot;little people,&quot; but it is good to know that Mary has her eyes on us. Why not? Isn&apos;t she the second Eve, the Mother of all the sons and daughters of God?</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F.

Note that the one long sentence which comprises the entire First Reading conveys several meaningful images. &#x201C;Rain and snow&#x201D; do many things: they provide moisture to the earth which prepares it for farming, which produces the seed which is later used to plant in order to produce more seed; and eventually that seed becomes the bread we eat which sustains our life.</p>\n<p>In the same way, the Word of God is not an empty gesture, it produces an effect. Like rain, the Word is sent for a purpose; it fulfills that purpose by preparing our souls to produce good fruit. Furthermore, since it is part of God&#x2019;s plan, God&#x2019;s Word cannot fail in accomplishing what it was sent to do, despite all the &#x201C;weeds&#x201D; and vandalism which it encounters. Some seed (God&#x2019;s Word) will not be successful because of the hardness of the ground (hearts) it encounters.

Jesus called them &#x201C;hard-hearted.&#x201D; But he also had a way to make them listen. If he spelled out clearly just how dumb and stupid they were, and how they were working against God&#x2019;s plan by placing obstacles in the way of people&#x2019;s spiritual journey, then they would ignore him or attack him. So instead he would Tell Stories. He had a special kind of story, called a Parable. It had a moral point to make, but did not attack anyone explicitly. Instead, you had to reflect on the story, and find the underlying truth &#x2013; as well as the identity of the real-life culprits being criticized (which just might be you and me).</p>\n<p>For example, how do you tell the Pharisees that they are &#x201C;hard-hearted&#x201D; because they will neither listen to nor accept his teachings about the kingdom of God? Well, &#x201C;There was a sower who went out to sow some seed&#x2026;some fell on rocky ground&#x2026;and it withered for lack of roots.&#x201D; And later, Jesus explains his parable, saying in part, &#x201C;The seed sown on the path is the one who hears the word of the kingdom without understanding it.&#x201D; The Pharisees probably knew that he was talking about them; but there was nothing they could do about it, because it was all &#x201C;hidden&#x201D; within the parable; no direct accusations had been made, no names had been dropped. So all they could do was burn and seethe with anger.</p>\n<p>Resistance to God&#x2019;s call to change our ways is &#x201C;hardness of heart.&#x201D; A modern example would be resistance to the Church&#x2019;s teachings on faith and morals (such as contraception, abortion, euthanasia, and capital punishment). Sometimes the seeds of the Church&#x2019;s teachings just fall on rocky ground, or on the barren path of our hearts. The Evil One is very active today!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>You and I are called to &#x201C;sow&#x201D; God&#x2019;s word in our children, and to live out the values that Jesus &#x201C;sowed&#x201D; in us through his Church; but first we must open our hardened hearts and become true disciples (CCC #546).

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>Q380: Why is the Prophet Amos being chased out of Bethel (First Reading, Amos 7:12-15)? The text today is silent about that.</strong></p>\n<p>Last week I talked about people who were &quot;uncomfortable&quot; in situations where they could control neither events nor the outcome. Today there is a different kind of &quot;discomfort&quot; - but this kind comes from being &quot;disturbed&quot; by hearing the word of God. Perhaps a better way of viewing those times when we feel &quot;uncomfortable&quot; hearing a reading or a homily, is to recognize that we are &quot;being challenged&quot; to become more responsible and just in all of our relationships.</p>\n<p>Amos was an ordinary lay person from Judah (southern kingdom) who was called by God to speak His word in Samaria (northern kingdom). Prophecy was not the normal &quot;career path&quot; for Amos, who worked in the vineyards and pastures. His message to Northern Israel was simple: the leaders and merchants were engaging in acts of gross injustice. This included cheating customers in the marketplace; being disdainful or inhospitable to strangers (especially females); and above all, disregarding the needs of the poor.</p>\n<p>The response of the Priest at Bethel in the north was to reject Amos as an &quot;outsider&quot; - after all, he wasn&apos;t even a citizen of the northern kingdom. Therefore his word was rejected, just as the &quot;migrant&quot; himself was rejected. In the Gospel today (Mk 6:7-13) Jesus warned the missionaries that they, too, would be rejected on many occasions. To reject the message and the messenger is to reject God Himself. Nevertheless, the duty of every disciple is to &quot;challenge the comfortable&quot; with the Truth. We need these reminders of the centrality of justice,charity and dignity for all humankind, otherwise we inadvertently build walls of exclusion. God&apos;s love knows no boundaries; neither must our love.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Evangelization (spreading the Good News of God&apos;s love for all) is not an option; it is an ordinary responsibility for each one of us (CCC #905). Justice is the keystone in all of our relationships (CCC #2411), because it is a basic right belonging to both man and God (CCC #1807).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q536: Is everyone being called to leave home and become missionaries, like the first disciples?</strong></p>\n<p>Three things are at work today in these readings: dependence on God, dependence on those we minister to, and dependence on our fellow workers. Despite opposition, the mission continues.</p>\n<p>Amos was from the south in Judah, and was sent to the north by God to preach against the economic injustice and idolatry that was prevalent in the northern kingdom of Israel (Amos 7:12-15). He was not a prophet nor a preacher, and yet was sent alone to minister in God&#x2019;s name. Therefore he had to depend entirely on the providence of God and those who were open to his message of repentance. It appears he may have gathered some followers, who collected his oracles and messages (as we have them in the bible), and provided support for his preaching efforts.</p>\n<p>The disciples of Jesus were sent out in pairs, to preach repentance and restore wholeness to the sick and possessed (Mark 6:7-13). They were to go without possessions, depending entirely on the providence of God and those to whom they ministered. Being in pairs, they were also able to support each other and help each other keep focused on their mission. They were not to waste time on those who rejected them and their message.</p>\n<p>Each one of us, by virtue of our baptism and confirmation, also has a disciple&#x2019;s responsibility to continue to spread the Good News about God&#x2019;s mercy, and call others to repentance. We support each other in this effort, particularly where a husband-wife relationship exists as they minister to their family, neighbors and co-workers.

    "markdown": "**Q380: Why is the Prophet Amos being chased out of Bethel (First Reading, Amos 7:12-15)? The text today is silent about that.**\n\nLast week I talked about people who were \"uncomfortable\" in situations where they could control neither events nor the outcome. Today there is a different kind of \"discomfort\" - but this kind comes from being \"disturbed\" by hearing the word of God. Perhaps a better way of viewing those times when we feel \"uncomfortable\" hearing a reading or a homily, is to recognize that we are \"being challenged\" to become more responsible and just in all of our relationships.\n\nAmos was an ordinary lay person from Judah (southern kingdom) who was called by God to speak His word in Samaria (northern kingdom). Prophecy was not the normal \"career path\" for Amos, who worked in the vineyards and pastures. His message to Northern Israel was simple: the leaders and merchants were engaging in acts of gross injustice. This included cheating customers in the marketplace; being disdainful or inhospitable to strangers (especially females); and above all, disregarding the needs of the poor.\n\nThe response of the Priest at Bethel in the north was to reject Amos as an \"outsider\" - after all, he wasn't even a citizen of the northern kingdom. Therefore his word was rejected, just as the \"migrant\" himself was rejected. In the Gospel today (Mk 6:7-13) Jesus warned the missionaries that they, too, would be rejected on many occasions. To reject the message and the messenger is to reject God Himself. Nevertheless, the duty of every disciple is to \"challenge the comfortable\" with the Truth. We need these reminders of the centrality of justice,charity and dignity for all humankind, otherwise we inadvertently build walls of exclusion. God's love knows no boundaries; neither must our love.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Evangelization (spreading the Good News of God's love for all) is not an option; it is an ordinary responsibility for each one of us (CCC #905). Justice is the keystone in all of our relationships (CCC #2411), because it is a basic right belonging to both man and God (CCC #1807).\n\n---\n\n**Q536: Is everyone being called to leave home and become missionaries, like the first disciples?**\n\nThree things are at work today in these readings: dependence on God, dependence on those we minister to, and dependence on our fellow workers. Despite opposition, the mission continues.\n\nAmos was from the south in Judah, and was sent to the north by God to preach against the economic injustice and idolatry that was prevalent in the northern kingdom of Israel (Amos 7:12-15). He was not a prophet nor a preacher, and yet was sent alone to minister in God’s name. Therefore he had to depend entirely on the providence of God and those who were open to his message of repentance. It appears he may have gathered some followers, who collected his oracles and messages (as we have them in the bible), and provided support for his preaching efforts.\n\nThe disciples of Jesus were sent out in pairs, to preach repentance and restore wholeness to the sick and possessed (Mark 6:7-13). They were to go without possessions, depending entirely on the providence of God and those to whom they ministered. Being in pairs, they were also able to support each other and help each other keep focused on their mission. They were not to waste time on those who rejected them and their message.\n\nEach one of us, by virtue of our baptism and confirmation, also has a disciple’s responsibility to continue to spread the Good News about God’s mercy, and call others to repentance. We support each other in this effort, particularly where a husband-wife relationship exists as they minister to their family, neighbors and co-workers. The key is dependence, prayer support, and perseverance, as well as recognizing and accepting rejection.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Those with a vocation to the religious life deserve the support of those to whom they minister (1 Tim 5:18). The latter have the duty and obligation to provide for the needs of the Church within their abilities (CCC #2043, 2122).\n\n---\n\n**We Are Chosen**\n\nThe opening of the Letter to the Ephesians reminds us of the mystery hidden in the depths of our life and personality. We have been chosen by God \"before the world began.\" God does not choose a featureless mass of people; in the words of Jesus, the Good Shepherd knows each sheep by name. There are all kinds of implications in this plan to be carried out in the fullness of time. Today's readings focus on our call and vocation in life.

Unlike the typical Chinese, Joseph was a Catholic, one of a family that had embraced the faith 300 years ago. Unlike the typical Chinese Catholic, he was also a man of means, highly respected in the commercial world of China, and even of Europe, where he had been decorated by the Belgian, French and Italian governments. But however successful he was in business affairs, Lo Pa-hong&apos;s principal concern in life was the spread of the gospel and its ideals of charity.</p>\n<p>One day in 1912 when this apostolic man was riding in his rickshaw through the city streets, a beggar approached him for alms. Lo saw the man was deathly sick, so he took him into his carriage to transport him to a hospital. But the hospital would not accept him, and the coolie pulling the rickshaw refused to transport him further because it would &quot;harm his business&quot;. So Joseph eventually hoisted the pauper on his own shoulders and brought him to his own home where he nursed him as well as he could. Other poor people heard of this and asked him to take them in, too. Lo Pa-hong soon opened a special house for the poor. It was the beginning of a series of charitable institutions - 16 in all - that he called St. Joseph&apos;s Hospice. At peak the Hospice had a population of 2000 sick (including ill prison inmates), orphans, abandoned children, etc. Under Joseph&apos;s daily supervision, the Hospice performed all the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. The founder supported it by begging, mostly from his non-Christian business friends.</p>\n<p>War, that enemy of Charity, struck China in the 1930&apos;s. The Japanese invaders besieged Shanghai. Lo Pa-hong lost much of his wealth in the siege. During the violence that followed, he lost his very life. On July 30, 1937 he set out from the Hospice to get some rice for his poor. Two assassins in the streets, mistaking his purpose, fired at him point-blank. The victim was taken to the hospital, received the last rites and died a few hours later.</p>\n<p>Given the opportunity before he died, this saintly Chinese Samaritan would doubtless have forgiven his murderers with all his heart.

But it is the same Christ who brings blacks and whites together in the spirit of His love. (Ephesians, 2:14. Today&apos;s second reading.)</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q537: It isn&#x2019;t very complimentary being called a &#x201C;sheep.&#x201D; Why did Jesus do that?</strong></p>\n<p>Immediately following today&#x2019;s gospel selection (Mark 6:30-34), after Jesus finishes his teaching, comes the miraculous feeding of the &#x201C;vast crowd&#x201D; (including 5,000 men, we are later told). The overriding theme in both the First Reading (Jer 23:1-6) and the Gospel is that of the Lord himself being the Shepherd of his people.</p>\n<p>Jesus compares the crowd to a huge flock of sheep without a shepherd. Notice how at least four elements are present at the physical level when he uses this image or metaphor. First, the sheep would wander away and get lost without a shepherd. Also, the wild animals in the hills and ravines would find the sheep to be &#x201C;easy prey.&#x201D; Third, when daylight came, there would be no one to lead them on the best paths to pastures. Finally, along with that &#x201C;absent leader&#x201D; role is the fact that when it came time to feed, the sheep would starve, not knowing where the pastures were located.</p>\n<p>But Jesus was also speaking to the spiritual level of the crowd. The civilian or governmental leadership was callous and greedy (e.g., King Herod). The religious leadership was also woefully inept &#x2013; they were supposed to lead the chosen people to the Messiah, and could not even recognize him. Furthermore, the religious leaders were in many cases self-serving and opportunistic (e.g., taking advantage of widows). Worst of all, they were bound up in rigid rules and regulations that became barriers to having a personal relationship with God.</p>\n<p>As prophesied (Jeremiah), Jesus himself provides truthful teachings about the kingdom of God, and feeds the crowd himself &#x2013; as any good shepherd would do for his sheep. All of the Old Testament scriptures are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as this one incident so wondrously demonstrates.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Before we can be effective ministers (all of us who are Baptized), we need to spend time being formed by our shepherd (CCC #428-9). He will also provide the real nourishment we need (CCC #1212, 1436).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Shepherd Us O Lord</strong></p>\n<p>Our world, our society, even our church are divided and somewhat scattered; it is regretful and painful. Jesus looks at us with pity as he did the people of his own day -- scattered like the sheep of Jeremiah&apos;s prophecy. Paul reminds us that we who once were divided have been brought together through the blood of Christ. Individually too we are divided like the flock. we are drawn in different directions by our desires and hopes, by requests for help from others, by demands that pressure us beyond the limits of our time and energy.

If you have ever ridden in a New York taxi, you know that the taxi-drivers of Gotham are pretty aggressive. One day according to a New York Times reporter, Joe ran into the back of a car. The driver of the car he hit was a black man named Bill. The damage wasn't serious, but Joe at once jumped out of his cab and began to assail Bill with loud, violent language, blaming him for the crash. Patrolman John Walsh came up quickly and arrested Joe for disorderly conduct. Bill came along to the court as a material witness.\n\nBy the time they reached the courtroom, Joe had cooled down and was ready to plead guilty. \"I guess I was wrong,\" he said to the magistrate. But I'm a good family man. I have a wife and kids at home.\" \"Be more careful in the future,\" the magistrate warned him. \"Ten dollars or three days in jail.\" Joe was shocked. \"I don't have the money. I'll have to go to jail.\" Then Bill stepped up and handed Joe a $20 bill. \"You don't have to do that,\" the judge told Bill. \"We'll raise the money some way.\" \"I want to do it,\" Bill answered. \"If you feel that way,\" the judge said, \"I'll suspend sentence. I certainly don't want it to cost you the money ... This is a wonderful story!\"\n\nJoe was even more amazed at Bill's action. \"Hey, you are a swell fellow! You're an all-right guy.\" He linked his arm with Bill's and the two left the courtroom together.\n\nSt. Paul said of Christ, \"It is He who is our peace, who made the two of us one by breaking down the barrier of hostility that kept us apart.\" Paul was speaking of Christ as the reconciler of Jew and Gentile in the Christian faith. But it is the same Christ who brings blacks and whites together in the spirit of His love. (Ephesians, 2:14. Today's second reading.)\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q537: It isn’t very complimentary being called a “sheep.” Why did Jesus do that?**\n\nImmediately following today’s gospel selection (Mark 6:30-34), after Jesus finishes his teaching, comes the miraculous feeding of the “vast crowd” (including 5,000 men, we are later told). The overriding theme in both the First Reading (Jer 23:1-6) and the Gospel is that of the Lord himself being the Shepherd of his people.\n\nJesus compares the crowd to a huge flock of sheep without a shepherd. Notice how at least four elements are present at the physical level when he uses this image or metaphor. First, the sheep would wander away and get lost without a shepherd. Also, the wild animals in the hills and ravines would find the sheep to be “easy prey.” Third, when daylight came, there would be no one to lead them on the best paths to pastures. Finally, along with that “absent leader” role is the fact that when it came time to feed, the sheep would starve, not knowing where the pastures were located.\n\nBut Jesus was also speaking to the spiritual level of the crowd. The civilian or governmental leadership was callous and greedy (e.g., King Herod). The religious leadership was also woefully inept – they were supposed to lead the chosen people to the Messiah, and could not even recognize him. Furthermore, the religious leaders were in many cases self-serving and opportunistic (e.g., taking advantage of widows). Worst of all, they were bound up in rigid rules and regulations that became barriers to having a personal relationship with God.\n\nAs prophesied (Jeremiah), Jesus himself provides truthful teachings about the kingdom of God, and feeds the crowd himself – as any good shepherd would do for his sheep. All of the Old Testament scriptures are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as this one incident so wondrously demonstrates.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Before we can be effective ministers (all of us who are Baptized), we need to spend time being formed by our shepherd (CCC #428-9). He will also provide the real nourishment we need (CCC #1212, 1436).\n\n---\n\n**Shepherd Us O Lord**\n\nOur world, our society, even our church are divided and somewhat scattered; it is regretful and painful. Jesus looks at us with pity as he did the people of his own day -- scattered like the sheep of Jeremiah's prophecy. Paul reminds us that we who once were divided have been brought together through the blood of Christ. Individually too we are divided like the flock. we are drawn in different directions by our desires and hopes, by requests for help from others, by demands that pressure us beyond the limits of our time and energy. But the pain of reconciliation is bearable because it entitles us to identify with Jesus on his cross.\n\n_Lord we have walked in ways that have divided and separated us in our very selves and from others. Make us one, Lord. May we dwell in your house united with all in the body of Christ, even with those whom we have offended and those who have offended us._",

We speak to him when we pray; we listen to him when we read his holy word (CCC #2653).\n\n---\n\n**One Thing Is Necessary**\n\nBoth the first and the third readings this Sunday deal with hospitality.  In Genesis we see Abram scurrying to greet his guests and prepare suitable refreshment for them, attentive to their every need.  He is rewarded for his efforts by the promise of a son.  In Luke we see Martha scurrying to prepare a meal for her guest Jesus.  It is a surprise when Jesus tells her she has her priorities wrong.  Why?  Martha had complained that her sister wasn't pulling her share of the work and Jesus was letting her get away with it!  But Jesus doesn't accept that view of the situation.  She has her priorities wrong. Unlike Abram and Mary she is so \"worried and distracted\" by the work, so concerned with her work that she has forgotten the point of it all.  One thing only is necessary -- attention to the guest, whether by attentive listening or by cooking. The point is that the one thing necessary is not the work but the primacy of Jesus and his word.  Discipleship is first and foremost a personal bonding with Jesus, the one thing necessary for those who would follow Jesus.\n\n_Dear Lord, I so often get like Martha, anxious and distracted over many things, trying to deal with many different demands on my time and attention.  I don't always get a clear view of priorities.  Let me hear your word speak to me so that I may know what your agenda is for me right now.  Like Samuel let me respond, \"Speak Lord, the servant heareth.\"_",

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>There Is No Slave Or Freeman</strong></p>\n<p>Officially the American Civil War was fought to preserve the Union the Americans achieved through the Revolution. But the initial and strongest issue at stake was the preservation or the abolition of black slavery. The North had no economic reason for keeping slavery. Slavery meant much to the economy of the South, particularly in the raising of cotton. Behind the ambivalent struggle loomed the debated question: Should any human person be held in bondage, especially in the &quot;Land of Liberty&quot;?</p>\n<p>During the War in 1863, President Lincoln&apos;s Emancipation Proclamation declared free all black slaves in the seceded Confederate states. The war came to an end on April 9, 1865 - four years after the firing of the first gun. Robert E. Lee, beloved head of the Confederate Armies, surrendered to General U.S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. Many of his loyal followers wanted to fight on; but Lee saw it would only waste life uselessly. Having handed over his sword, the Southern leader returned home, now a private citizen.</p>\n<p>How would the General accommodate the Emancipation? Basically, he was no lover of slavery, having fought the war in defense of state&apos;s rights. A few weeks after Appomattox, he showed his attitude towards emancipation at St. Paul&apos;s Episcopal Church in Richmond. At communion time, a newly freed Black rose and went to the railing. Now, in pre-war southern churches (Catholic as well as Protestant), there had been a social segregation. Here is how Lee&apos;s biographer Charles Bracelen Flood describes what happened.</p>\n<p>&quot;The congregation froze: those who had been ready to go forward and kneel at the altar rail remained in their pews ... General Robert E. Lee was present and, ignoring the action of the Negro, arose in his usual dignified and self-possessed manner, and reverently knelt down to partake of the communion, not far from the Negro. The other communicants went forward to the altar and the service continued.&quot;</p>\n<p>General Lee knew what St. Paul had written: &quot;There is no Greek or Jew here, slave or freeman.&quot; We who believe that also should be leaders in social justice.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q278: How does one reconcile today&#x2019;s gospel (Lk 12:13-21) about storing the excess harvest with the need to provide for one&#x2019;s future, including retirement?</strong></p>\n<p>I remember Fr. Bill Grimm&#x2019;s vivid comment a few years ago to the effect that Greed so tightly squeezes shut the heart, that love cannot get out, nor can love get in! It is our attitude towards our possessions, and also our attitude towards their acquisition, that provides a correct insight into our &#x201C;heart condition.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The gospels clearly show us that anything that interferes with our call to holiness is useful material for Jesus to criticize. After all, his mission is to show us how to live a life of true discipleship, a life of love modeled on the example of his own life. Jesus shows us how to be giving, loving, and self-sacrificing, even if it means laying down your life out of love for another.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, if one is closing one&#x2019;s heart to the needs of others around them, then the &#x201C;heart valve&#x201D; is being governed by the deadly sin of Greed. However, since the poor and needy are always around us, the virtue of justice demands that our first priority ought to be and must be to care for them. One can respond to &#x201C;undesirable obstacles&#x201D; in at least four ways: destroy the obstacle (e.g., abortion, euthanasia, war); ignore the obstacle (e.g., like the rich man and the beggar Lazarus always at his doorstep); forget the obstacle (e.g., preoccupation with fulfilling my own desires that crowds out more significant needs of others); and finally, whether reluctantly or joyfully, lovingly engage the obstacle which then becomes not an obstacle but a shared family burden that recognizes another &#x201C;family member&#x201D; in need.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Greed or &#x201C;avarice&#x201D; is one of the &#x201C;seven capital sins&#x201D; -- called capital because they lead to other sins (CCC #1866). Greed is also called one of the &#x201C;seven deadly sins&#x201D; because it causes the spiritual death of the soul if not resisted. It reflects the intention of the heart, and violates the Tenth Commandment (CCC #2534). An excessive desire for power, riches, and material goods is a serious disorder of natural and good desires (CCC #2535-36). An indicator: at income tax time, what percent of your adjusted gross income goes to charity?</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q591: Why do the New Testament bible stories and exhortations always seem to come down hard on people who have riches?</strong></p>\n<p>Over time our language changes, and it becomes more difficult to understand the meaning of certain ancient words or phrases. Today&#x2019;s First Reading (Eccl 1:2; 2:21-23) is a good example of that. &#x201C;Vanity of vanities,&#x201D; says our author. Now be honest: have you ever used that three-word phrase in your life, other than reading the bible? Today we would be inclined to say something like &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all smoke and mirrors&#x201D; &#x2013; just like we do when we describe the claims and promises and hidden maneuvers of so many insincere politicians. In other words, there is simply no lasting substance; instead there is a real emptiness in terms of accomplishments.</p>\n<p>That is precisely the message that the author is trying to convey to his listeners. He is not a prosperity-gospel idealist, but a realist. He is pointing out the real danger of possessions: that when we begin to acquire, we want more, and begin to trust in our prosperity rather than God. Soon we can lose the perspective of recognizing when enough is enough, as well as the true source of all goodness.</p>\n<p>The spiritual danger is that we unthinkingly accept false standards and goals. Jesus pointed this out in today&#x2019;s gospel (Luke 12:13-21) in very vivid and strong terms. It might seem to be a nice goal to accumulate wealth, and then retire to a beach villa. To be able to do that demonstrates that the person has prepared well for his or her physical future. But Jesus asks us: how much preparation have you put into your spiritual future? Is it possible that I am the Fool that Jesus is talking about? Which is more important &#x2013; my physical or spiritual welfare?</p>\n<p>In your home today, take a look around you &#x2013; including your closets, basement, checkbook, investment portfolio, and charitable contributions. Ask Jesus to take a tour of your home; then ask him to take a tour of your soul. Listen to what he has to say to you about your future. Is your life all &#x201C;smoke and mirrors&#x201D;?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Jesus came to free us from slavery to sin, including the sins of greed, lack of trust in divine providence, and indifference to the poor.

    "markdown": "**There Is No Slave Or Freeman**\n\nOfficially the American Civil War was fought to preserve the Union the Americans achieved through the Revolution. But the initial and strongest issue at stake was the preservation or the abolition of black slavery. The North had no economic reason for keeping slavery. Slavery meant much to the economy of the South, particularly in the raising of cotton. Behind the ambivalent struggle loomed the debated question: Should any human person be held in bondage, especially in the \"Land of Liberty\"?\n\nDuring the War in 1863, President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation declared free all black slaves in the seceded Confederate states. The war came to an end on April 9, 1865 - four years after the firing of the first gun. Robert E. Lee, beloved head of the Confederate Armies, surrendered to General U.S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. Many of his loyal followers wanted to fight on; but Lee saw it would only waste life uselessly. Having handed over his sword, the Southern leader returned home, now a private citizen.\n\nHow would the General accommodate the Emancipation? Basically, he was no lover of slavery, having fought the war in defense of state's rights. A few weeks after Appomattox, he showed his attitude towards emancipation at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Richmond. At communion time, a newly freed Black rose and went to the railing. Now, in pre-war southern churches (Catholic as well as Protestant), there had been a social segregation. Here is how Lee's biographer Charles Bracelen Flood describes what happened.\n\n\"The congregation froze: those who had been ready to go forward and kneel at the altar rail remained in their pews ... General Robert E. Lee was present and, ignoring the action of the Negro, arose in his usual dignified and self-possessed manner, and reverently knelt down to partake of the communion, not far from the Negro. The other communicants went forward to the altar and the service continued.\"\n\nGeneral Lee knew what St. Paul had written: \"There is no Greek or Jew here, slave or freeman.\" We who believe that also should be leaders in social justice.\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q278: How does one reconcile today’s gospel (Lk 12:13-21) about storing the excess harvest with the need to provide for one’s future, including retirement?**\n\nI remember Fr. Bill Grimm’s vivid comment a few years ago to the effect that Greed so tightly squeezes shut the heart, that love cannot get out, nor can love get in! It is our attitude towards our possessions, and also our attitude towards their acquisition, that provides a correct insight into our “heart condition.”\n\nThe gospels clearly show us that anything that interferes with our call to holiness is useful material for Jesus to criticize. After all, his mission is to show us how to live a life of true discipleship, a life of love modeled on the example of his own life. Jesus shows us how to be giving, loving, and self-sacrificing, even if it means laying down your life out of love for another.\n\nAccordingly, if one is closing one’s heart to the needs of others around them, then the “heart valve” is being governed by the deadly sin of Greed. However, since the poor and needy are always around us, the virtue of justice demands that our first priority ought to be and must be to care for them. One can respond to “undesirable obstacles” in at least four ways: destroy the obstacle (e.g., abortion, euthanasia, war); ignore the obstacle (e.g., like the rich man and the beggar Lazarus always at his doorstep); forget the obstacle (e.g., preoccupation with fulfilling my own desires that crowds out more significant needs of others); and finally, whether reluctantly or joyfully, lovingly engage the obstacle which then becomes not an obstacle but a shared family burden that recognizes another “family member” in need.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Greed or “avarice” is one of the “seven capital sins” -- called capital because they lead to other sins (CCC #1866). Greed is also called one of the “seven deadly sins” because it causes the spiritual death of the soul if not resisted. It reflects the intention of the heart, and violates the Tenth Commandment (CCC #2534). An excessive desire for power, riches, and material goods is a serious disorder of natural and good desires (CCC #2535-36). An indicator: at income tax time, what percent of your adjusted gross income goes to charity?\n\n---\n\n**Q591: Why do the New Testament bible stories and exhortations always seem to come down hard on people who have riches?**\n\nOver time our language changes, and it becomes more difficult to understand the meaning of certain ancient words or phrases. Today’s First Reading (Eccl 1:2; 2:21-23) is a good example of that. “Vanity of vanities,” says our author. Now be honest: have you ever used that three-word phrase in your life, other than reading the bible? Today we would be inclined to say something like “It’s all smoke and mirrors” – just like we do when we describe the claims and promises and hidden maneuvers of so many insincere politicians. In other words, there is simply no lasting substance; instead there is a real emptiness in terms of accomplishments.\n\nThat is precisely the message that the author is trying to convey to his listeners. He is not a prosperity-gospel idealist, but a realist. He is pointing out the real danger of possessions: that when we begin to acquire, we want more, and begin to trust in our prosperity rather than God. Soon we can lose the perspective of recognizing when enough is enough, as well as the true source of all goodness.\n\nThe spiritual danger is that we unthinkingly accept false standards and goals. Jesus pointed this out in today’s gospel (Luke 12:13-21) in very vivid and strong terms. It might seem to be a nice goal to accumulate wealth, and then retire to a beach villa. To be able to do that demonstrates that the person has prepared well for his or her physical future. But Jesus asks us: how much preparation have you put into your spiritual future? Is it possible that I am the Fool that Jesus is talking about? Which is more important – my physical or spiritual welfare?\n\nIn your home today, take a look around you – including your closets, basement, checkbook, investment portfolio, and charitable contributions. Ask Jesus to take a tour of your home; then ask him to take a tour of your soul. Listen to what he has to say to you about your future. Is your life all “smoke and mirrors”?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Jesus came to free us from slavery to sin, including the sins of greed, lack of trust in divine providence, and indifference to the poor. We cannot be called God’s children when we remain so enslaved (CCC 549). It is good to remember the well-worn phrase, “I am just passing through” this earthly world, and act accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**A Word to the Wise**\n\nThe Book of Ecclesiastes in the first reading stresses the importance of right priorities for true wisdom.  \"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.\"  In Hebrew \"vanity\" was a vapor, a passing breeze, so wisdom should enable us to see the difference between what has value and what is a mere wisp of passing air.  St. Paul too stresses the importance of right priorities: \"If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above.\"  And Jesus gives us a parable about a rich man who is a fool because he cannot tell the difference between what has real value and what is ultimately worthless.\n\nHe allows self to take precedence over his covenant relationships.  His land produced abundantly but whatever the human contribution it is the land that produces the food and the land is a gift of God, a gift he has given to the whole people of Israel.  The individual was just the steward for God and the community.  The rich man has forgotten the Torah teaching that the goods of the earth are meant to meet the needs of all, not simply the demands of those who own the land.  He speaks of \"my\" crops being stored for his own exclusive use rather than as a blessing for the community.  His focus is entirely on himself: \"I will say to myself...\"  But then, surprise, surprise!  A forgotten voice is heard: \"But God said...\" The man stands revealed as having allowed his greed to destroy his covenant relationships, with the earth which he manages as God's agent and with his community for whom he was responsible, to his God.\n\n_Lord, Is it possible that this parable has something to say to me?  Are my priorities those of the wise? Those of a Christian?  Do I see my possessions as held in trust for the good of the community?  Lord give me wisdom.  Help me to see what the true values are.  Make me more giving, not just of what I own but of my self._",

Some Hesquiat Indians on the nearby shore, seeing that the ship was in distress, jumped into their canoes, and braved high waves to come to the sailors&apos; aid. However, the crew feared that the natives were hostile, so they gestured them away. Although these Indians were not yet Christian, they had already learned of the Christian respect for the sign of the cross. To prove that they came in peace, they blessed themselves so that the sailors could see them. As a countersign, the crew also made the sign of the cross. Then they let the Hesquiats come aboard the foundering vessel.</p>\n<p>Shortly after, rescuers and shipwrecked disembarked in the canoes and soon reached the safety of the beach. ...Jesus hastened to reassure them: &quot;Get hold of yourselves! It is I. Do not be afraid!&quot; (Matthew, 14:27. Gospel of the day.)</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q331: Why is St. Paul willing to be &#x201C;condemned&#x201D; and forfeit eternal life for the Jewish rejection of Jesus (Rom 9:1-5)?</strong></p>\n<p>Today&#x2019;s three readings are all within the contest of some form of &#x201C;turbulence,&#x201D; and it is right there that the participants find God in a special way. In the case of St. Paul, he has suffered much from his fellow Jews &#x2013; stoning, persecution, whippings, and imprisonment. Yet it is within this turbulence that Paul comes closest to Jesus, sharing in His suffering.</p>\n<p>Paul&#x2019;s suffering was also experienced at a deeper level. He has already given his inspired teachings about unity in the Body of Christ, and about believers becoming &#x201C;one bread, one body.&#x201D; So it was especially painful to him that his fellow Jews were rejecting Jesus, refusing to believe that he was the Risen Son of God. The Jews had so much to be thankful for: they were &#x201C;chosen,&#x201D; they had the covenants, the Torah, the Temple, the promises, the patriarchs and prophets. Yet now it all seemed to be lost.</p>\n<p>Did he &#x201C;write them off&#x201D; as a lost cause, since they had rejected God&#x2019;s Son? Not at all! It caused Paul&#x2019;s heart &#x201C;great grief and constant pain&#x201D; to such an extent that out of love he was willing to suffer separation from Christ if it would result in the salvation of the Jews!</p>\n<p>There is a great mystery here. Paul knew that Jesus suffered and died for all humanity - past, present and future. He knew, therefore, what redemptive suffering was all about, and that somehow if we offer our own sufferings to Christ then they, too, somehow become redemptive for others. This is why the power of our intercessory prayer must never be forgotten. Through the Church (the Body of Christ), all who suffer &#x2013; whether Christian or not &#x2013; are embraced by Christ who makes their suffering his own. As Pope John Paul II taught, in that unity of suffering with Christ, even the suffering of non-Christians is somehow contributing to the world&#x2019;s redemption (Salvifici Doloris, 24).</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!&#xA0; </strong>We can deliberately enter into the divine plan by our actions, prayers, and sufferings (CCC#307). Common sense tells us that &#x201C;praying for our enemies&#x201D; must not be an idle or useless action, otherwise Jesus would not have asked us to do so. How much more ought we pray for those who reject Jesus, or for those who do not know him (CCC #839-843)? Intercession has been a powerful act of selfless compassion since the time of Abraham (CCC #2635), and recognizes no boundaries (CCC #2636).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q488: How can we increase our Faith, so that we don&#x2019;t &#x201C;sink&#x201D; into the sea like Peter in today&#x2019;s gospel (Matthew 14:22-33)?</strong></p>\n<p>I recall the words of a Canadian friend (Rev.

On the other hand, if we keep our focus on the Source of our safety, our salvation, the One to whom we call out to save us, then the winds die down, and we are once again content in the Presence of the Lord. This is the way we increase or sustain our faith: by never doubting that the Presence of the Lord is with us every single moment of our lives!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>When we cry out &#x201C;Lord,&#x201D; it expresses our recognition of the divine mystery of Jesus.

In the Gospel the disciples encounter a storm at sea, the traditional symbol of a chaotic world alienated from God. But Jesus comes to them and calls Peter to himself. Peter responds in faith, but begins to sink when he focuses on his own perilous position instead of on the Lord who calls him. Jesus rebukes Peter&apos;s lack of faith but reaches out to lift him up. Living a Christian life in the midst of a chaotic world is sometimes like that. We often look for God&apos;s presence in great miracles and visions which have sometimes revealed God&apos;s presence.

Suddenly, the kids heard U.S. bombers overhead. Instinctively, they threw themselves face-down upon the ground. A moment later the first atomic bomb exploded. It sent forth a lurid yellow light, and flying balls of fire struck Tadashi and set his clothing afire. He plunged into the river, but pain stabbed every part of his body. When he crawled out of the water he found his skin hanging from him like ribbons.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, his father found the lad and took him to a Jesuit residence hard by. The superior, a Spanish priest named Pedro Arrupe, took Tadashi in and gave him whatever first aid he could. For weeks the boy was in a critical condition, his body full of sores and infection. The Hasegamas, who visited him often, were Buddhists, but they were touched by the Jesuit&apos;s remarks about God, Jesus Christ at the crucifixion. When the priest suggested baptism of Tadashi, they were not opposed. After baptism Tadashi slept for a whole week. When he finally woke up, his wounds were almost healed.</p>\n<p>In today&apos;s parable, our Lord teaches God&apos;s fatherly concern for each of us. He says that our heavenly Father, no more than an earthly father, would give his son a snake when he asked for a fish. We can carry the parable a little farther, however, then say that sometimes God does give us what looks like a snake, but then turns it into a fish. Tadashi&apos;s trials eventually bore the fruit of faith, baptism and finally a vocation to the priesthood. When an editor at St. Anthony&apos;s Messenger recently interviewed Father Tadashi, now a pastor at Hiroshima, he found him a man who blamed the sinfulness of mankind rather than the American bombers for the destruction of Hiroshima. Naturally, he is a strong opponent of nuclear warfare, but not so much out of fear as out of hope that men may henceforth cultivate peace.</p>\n<p>Thus God gave Tadashi tribulation, but by means of tribulation, true Christian wisdom.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F.

I have been a Retreat Director on several occasions, and I notice that one goal of many Retreatants and spiritual book-buyers seems to be to draw closer to God through prayer &#x2013; an excellent goal! But I also notice an unnecessary concern to learn &#x201C;how&#x201D; to pray better, or &#x201C;what words&#x201D; to use, or &#x201C;what posture,&#x201D; and so on.</p>\n<p>Jesus gives us great advice in today&#x2019;s Gospel (Luke 11:1-13). First, he teaches us to keep it Simple and Meaningful. Never worry about &#x201C;what&#x201D; to say; just say what is in your heart. The Lord&#x2019;s Prayer is probably the simplest prayer there is, with very few words. But when prayed sincerely from the heart, it is all that is needed. Worship the Father; ask for your real daily needs, including forgiveness; forgive all with whom you hold resentments; and ask God not to test your faith right now &#x2013; because you might fail!</p>\n<p>Second, Jesus teaches us to Trust that our Father hears and answers each and every prayer. There are no exceptions! So &#x201C;ask away&#x201D;! [Remember that Abraham (First Reading, Genesis 18:20-32) was bold enough to ask God to save an entire town, even if there were only a small handful of virtuous people to be found there.] Our Father always responds in the most lovable and just manner possible. Perhaps we might think our request went unanswered? Not so &#x2013; we need to see with the &#x201C;eyes of faith&#x201D; that our Father cares, hears, and answers. In case you doubt, Jesus gives two great examples: no loving Father would give his child a scorpion or a snake in response to a simple request for bread and eggs!</p>\n<p>We believe that we indeed have a loving, caring Father in heaven! And so we have the courage to pray the Our Father at the very beginning of the Communion Rite at each Mass. The next time (and every time thereafter), pray it with meaning, from your heart!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> &#x201C;When&#x201D; can we pray? It is possible to offer fervent prayer even while walking in public&#x2026;or seated in your shop&#x2026;while buying and selling&#x2026;or even while cooking. [St. John Chrysostom, quoted in CCC #2743.] The important thing is: DO IT! BELIEVE the words in today&#x2019;s Responsorial Psalm (Ps. 138:1-3,6-8).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q590: Why was Abraham haggling with God over the sinful cities of Sodom and Gomorrah?</strong></p>\n<p>Today we have two readings that emphasize persistence in petitionary prayer. In the First Reading (Genesis 18:20-32) Abraham sounds and acts like a camel trader. He keeps negotiating the price needed to avoid the destruction of the sinful cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. His haggling with God is about the number of righteous people needed to save the city. The dialogue reveals not only God&#x2019;s compassion and response to prayer; it also reflects Abraham&#x2019;s compassionate heart and his concern for his nephew Lot, who lives in Sodom. Comforting is the observation that even if only a handful of virtuous people can be found in the city, it will not be destroyed &#x2013; the lesson being that the morally just person(s) is really the true life of the entire community.</p>\n<p>The Gospel (Luke 11:1-13) is also about persistence in prayer. This section of Luke has been called a basic catechism on prayer, and rightly so. Jesus teaches us how to pray; he urges us to be persistent; and he wants us to believe and trust that the Lord really does hear and answer our prayers. There is nothing in the words of Jesus that tells us what posture to use during prayer, or how long the period of time ought to be for our daily prayer. The most important element is not the prayer technique, but simply that we pray&#x2014;and that we are faithful in making this the very highest priority in our daily activities.</p>\n<p>St. Alphonsus Liguori once said these famous and sobering words: &#x201C;Those who pray are certainly saved; those who do not pray are certainly condemned&#x201D; (CCC 2744). He was spot-on (as our British friends say), because one&#x2019;s faithfulness to daily prayer is a prime measure of one&#x2019;s relationship (or lack thereof) to God.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Our Father knows what we need before we ask him, but he awaits our petition because the dignity of his children lies in their freedom.

    "markdown": "**A snake or a fish?**\n\nOn August 6, 1945, Tadashi Hasegama, aged 14, was seated with some schoolmates on a riverbank about one mile from the center of the city of Hiroshima, Japan. Suddenly, the kids heard U.S. bombers overhead. Instinctively, they threw themselves face-down upon the ground. A moment later the first atomic bomb exploded. It sent forth a lurid yellow light, and flying balls of fire struck Tadashi and set his clothing afire. He plunged into the river, but pain stabbed every part of his body. When he crawled out of the water he found his skin hanging from him like ribbons.\n\nFortunately, his father found the lad and took him to a Jesuit residence hard by. The superior, a Spanish priest named Pedro Arrupe, took Tadashi in and gave him whatever first aid he could. For weeks the boy was in a critical condition, his body full of sores and infection. The Hasegamas, who visited him often, were Buddhists, but they were touched by the Jesuit's remarks about God, Jesus Christ at the crucifixion. When the priest suggested baptism of Tadashi, they were not opposed. After baptism Tadashi slept for a whole week. When he finally woke up, his wounds were almost healed.\n\nIn today's parable, our Lord teaches God's fatherly concern for each of us. He says that our heavenly Father, no more than an earthly father, would give his son a snake when he asked for a fish. We can carry the parable a little farther, however, then say that sometimes God does give us what looks like a snake, but then turns it into a fish. Tadashi's trials eventually bore the fruit of faith, baptism and finally a vocation to the priesthood. When an editor at St. Anthony's Messenger recently interviewed Father Tadashi, now a pastor at Hiroshima, he found him a man who blamed the sinfulness of mankind rather than the American bombers for the destruction of Hiroshima. Naturally, he is a strong opponent of nuclear warfare, but not so much out of fear as out of hope that men may henceforth cultivate peace.\n\nThus God gave Tadashi tribulation, but by means of tribulation, true Christian wisdom.\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q434: How can I learn to pray better? I am not very good a praying, compared to some “prayer warriors” that I know.**\n\nI don’t know how many of you have been on a spiritual Retreat, or purchased books on Prayer. I have been a Retreat Director on several occasions, and I notice that one goal of many Retreatants and spiritual book-buyers seems to be to draw closer to God through prayer – an excellent goal! But I also notice an unnecessary concern to learn “how” to pray better, or “what words” to use, or “what posture,” and so on.\n\nJesus gives us great advice in today’s Gospel (Luke 11:1-13).

Don&apos;t incense and the scents of flowers charm us with moments of contentment?</p>\n<p>Among God&apos;s miracles are the sweet odors which he has time again caused to come forth from the bodies of saintly people. Sometimes it occurs after their death, as it did in the case of St. Martin DePorres. Sometimes it occurs while they are alive. When a priest-friend of St. Theresa of Avila first noticed a fragrance surrounding St. Teresa of Avila, he thought she had been wearing perfume!</p>\n<p>One of the holy people gifted recently with this miraculous gift was the Capuchin priest, Padre Pio Forgione (1887-1968). He had the stigmata, or wounds of Christ&apos;s crucifixion in his hands and feet, and these often gave off a sweet scent. Even more marvelously, he seemed to be able to &quot;broadcast&quot; perfumes of one sort or another, to indicate to people far away that they were in his thoughts and prayers.</p>\n<p>On February 15, 1950, for instance, an Italian physician was visiting with the Bertolo family, who knew Padre Pio well and had often experienced this perfume phenomenon. That day another caller at the Bertolo&apos;s had just returned from a visit to the friar at his monastery in San Giovanni Rotondo. He was describing the great humility of the Padre despite his fame, when suddenly the physician recalled &quot;an intense perfume of violets enveloped us all, lasting about a half hour, although the doors and windows were wide open.&quot; Another physician who was there, Dr. Edoardo Bianco, signed an affidavit about the same waft of violet perfume. He said that on other similar occasions he had smelt the perfume of roses and carnations; and he declared there was no scientific explanation for what had happened.</p>\n<p>Today St. Paul tells us that Christ&apos;s offering of himself to God was &quot;a gift of pleasing fragrance.&quot; By his &quot;perfume miracles&quot; is not God reminding us that no incense we offer Him is sweeter than the total gift of ourselves?

Note that in this example, corruption can only be caused internally because of inattention to proper sealing. Usually this wine bottle seal will authenticate its true source, identifying the contents with the winery label.</p>\n<p>Now listen to St. Paul in the Second Reading: &quot;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God with which you were sealed for the day of redemption.&quot; Immediately in the next line, we hear the kind of behavior - originating from within - that causes the &quot;Sealer&quot; to grieve: bitterness, anger, shouting, reviling, and malice. To prevent that inner corruption of our soul from taking place, we live out the virtues that St. Paul also names today: kindness, compassion, forgiveness, and love.</p>\n<p>Note that the corruption of the soul can only take place from within! The seal of the Holy Spirit always remains intact, but the free will of the soul is also intact. Certainly there are external temptations, but we still have our free will. We can choose to live a life of rebellion that acts as a corruptive force in opposition to the will of God; but we alone make that choice, no one else. We can choose to give in to the temptations around us to abuse God&apos;s gifts. And paramount among these temptations is rejecting authority - ignoring the teachings of the Church (or at least choosing to deprive ourselves of a fully informed conscience).</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> The Holy Spirit marked us with the seal of the Lord at our Baptism, and we are called to &quot;keep the seal&quot; until the end of our earthly life (CCC #1274).

Confession cleanses us of this corruption, and Eucharist nourishes us so that we can be transformed daily into the image of Christ (CCC #1275): are we making regular use of both?</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q540: How could the bread that Elijah consumed sustain him for a forty-day trip?</strong></p>\n<p>There are a lot of folks who have a relationship with Jesus and his Church that leaves much to be desired.

Because be could not find any woman that measured up to his ideal of womanhood, he decided not to marry. Instead, he undertook to carve a statue of a woman that fulfilled his dreams.\n\nThe statue that he carved was outstandingly beautiful. He treated it as if it were real, dressing it in the loveliest clothing, decorating it with jewelry of gold and precious stones. Next time he visited the temple of Venus, the goddess of love, he timidly prayed that she give him a wife \"like my statue.\" Venus took note of the prayer. When Pygmalion returned home and kissed his beautiful statue, it came to life. Taking the name Galatea, she accepted Pygmalion's hand in marriage. Fact is even more wonderful than fiction.

This was the passage that changed his life: &quot;Let us cast off deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. Let us live honorably&#x2026;not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual excess and lust, not in quarreling and jealousies. Rather, put on the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>\n<p>Augustine, you will recall, was a Roman native of Northern Africa, the son of a pagan father and the devout Christian mother whom we venerate as St. Monica. To the grief of his mother, her brilliant son grew up more heathen than Christian. He became an expert in public speaking, teaching that subject both in Africa and in Italy. But he also fell into heretical ways of thinking and pagan ways of living. Monica found that her warnings were ineffectual, so she fell back on prayer. Her prayers were long unanswered, but she kept right on.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, Augustine was more of a Christian than he himself realized. As he grew older, he found that his heretical friends did not have all the answers; and that his lust enslaved rather than liberated him. More and more he became convinced that the gospel was true. But the cravings of the flesh held him back from an act of faith. He prayed to God &quot;Grant me chastity and continence, but not yet!&quot;</p>\n<p>Then one day in the year 386, as he sat weeping over the problem in his garden in Milan, he heard over the wall the singsong of a child. &quot;Pick up and read, pick up and read&quot;. It was such a strange song that he took it as a hint. A copy lay there of St. Paul&apos;s letter to the Romans. He picked it up and his eyes fell on the passage quoted above. As he read it, God&apos;s grace flooded his soul. Suddenly he felt no more shackled by his sexual drives. To Monica&apos;s great joy he accepted baptism. As we know, he went on to become a priest, a bishop and one of the greatest Christian theologians of all time.</p>\n<p>The words of the Scriptures are so familiar to us that too often we ignore their message. During this Advent, why not read them or listen to them with fuller attention? The Holy Spirit may have picked out a passage there that could change our lives.</p>\n<p>-Fr. Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q295: Today&apos;s gospel is scary (Mt 24:37-44). Is it hopeless and useless to be concerned about the &quot;end,&quot; which absolutely no one can foresee or predict?</strong></p>\n<p>On the contrary, we must be very hopeful -- Christ has given us a very clear, daily objective to work towards. The objective is to &quot;be prepared&quot; at all times -- not in fear, but in the hope of being ready to receive our Savior, Jesus. We must also be very concerned that we are doing all we can to welcome Jesus now, so that he will welcome us later.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind the context of these so-called &quot;end time&quot; passages in scripture. Just before our gospel today, Christ is weeping over Jerusalem for not recognizing him and accepting him. Then comes the warning to &quot;be prepared,&quot; followed by two parables on preparedness. Finally comes the last judgment scene, when all people are judged by how they recognized and responded to Jesus in the needy they encountered daily.</p>\n<p>This is one of those &quot;Just as...So...&quot; episodes. Just as the people in Noah&apos;s time had ample warning, still they did not heed the call to prepare their hearts; so they experienced the devastation of &quot;the flood.&quot; Just as the people and leaders in Jerusalem ignored Jesus&apos; appeal for covenant love and the removal of barriers between God and Others, so they experienced the devastation of the loss of &quot;the temple&quot; and &quot;the land.&quot; In this First Sunday of Advent, we hear Jesus repeat his loving concern, his warning: &quot;just as... so you had better prepare your heart, repent, and serve my needy people.&quot; This is a message of hope, not of despair.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> There is no way we will know precisely when that &quot;final hour&quot; will come about, and Jesus tells us that information will not be revealed to us (CCC #673). The present times are the &quot;time of the Spirit and of witness&quot; about the Good News of salvation through Jesus Christ (CCC #672). In the meantime we walk the walk of faith and in the hope that inspires us to serve all of God&apos;s people (CCC #1818).</p>\n<p>====</p> \n\t\t",

Let us live honorably…not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual excess and lust, not in quarreling and jealousies. Rather, put on the Lord Jesus Christ.\"\n\nAugustine, you will recall, was a Roman native of Northern Africa, the son of a pagan father and the devout Christian mother whom we venerate as St. Monica. To the grief of his mother, her brilliant son grew up more heathen than Christian. He became an expert in public speaking, teaching that subject both in Africa and in Italy. But he also fell into heretical ways of thinking and pagan ways of living. Monica found that her warnings were ineffectual, so she fell back on prayer. Her prayers were long unanswered, but she kept right on.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Augustine was more of a Christian than he himself realized. As he grew older, he found that his heretical friends did not have all the answers; and that his lust enslaved rather than liberated him. More and more he became convinced that the gospel was true. But the cravings of the flesh held him back from an act of faith. He prayed to God \"Grant me chastity and continence, but not yet!\"\n\nThen one day in the year 386, as he sat weeping over the problem in his garden in Milan, he heard over the wall the singsong of a child. \"Pick up and read, pick up and read\". It was such a strange song that he took it as a hint. A copy lay there of St. Paul's letter to the Romans. He picked it up and his eyes fell on the passage quoted above. As he read it, God's grace flooded his soul. Suddenly he felt no more shackled by his sexual drives. To Monica's great joy he accepted baptism. As we know, he went on to become a priest, a bishop and one of the greatest Christian theologians of all time.\n\nThe words of the Scriptures are so familiar to us that too often we ignore their message. During this Advent, why not read them or listen to them with fuller attention? The Holy Spirit may have picked out a passage there that could change our lives.\n\n\\-Fr. Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q295: Today's gospel is scary (Mt 24:37-44). Is it hopeless and useless to be concerned about the \"end,\" which absolutely no one can foresee or predict?**\n\nOn the contrary, we must be very hopeful -- Christ has given us a very clear, daily objective to work towards. The objective is to \"be prepared\" at all times -- not in fear, but in the hope of being ready to receive our Savior, Jesus. We must also be very concerned that we are doing all we can to welcome Jesus now, so that he will welcome us later.\n\nKeep in mind the context of these so-called \"end time\" passages in scripture. Just before our gospel today, Christ is weeping over Jerusalem for not recognizing him and accepting him. Then comes the warning to \"be prepared,\" followed by two parables on preparedness. Finally comes the last judgment scene, when all people are judged by how they recognized and responded to Jesus in the needy they encountered daily.\n\nThis is one of those \"Just as...So...\" episodes. Just as the people in Noah's time had ample warning, still they did not heed the call to prepare their hearts; so they experienced the devastation of \"the flood.\" Just as the people and leaders in Jerusalem ignored Jesus' appeal for covenant love and the removal of barriers between God and Others, so they experienced the devastation of the loss of \"the temple\" and \"the land.\" In this First Sunday of Advent, we hear Jesus repeat his loving concern, his warning: \"just as... so you had better prepare your heart, repent, and serve my needy people.\" This is a message of hope, not of despair.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** There is no way we will know precisely when that \"final hour\" will come about, and Jesus tells us that information will not be revealed to us (CCC #673). The present times are the \"time of the Spirit and of witness\" about the Good News of salvation through Jesus Christ (CCC #672). In the meantime we walk the walk of faith and in the hope that inspires us to serve all of God's people (CCC #1818).\n\n---",

Unless we constantly recall that Satan, rejected once, will try again and again on another opportunity, we cannot appreciate what a persistent nuisance he is.</p>\n<p>All human beings are subjected to temptations. St. Anthony of Egypt is the saint best equipped to be a patron of those tested by Satan. St. Jerome tells us his story.</p>\n<p>Anthony, who flourished in the third century, had left his Egyptian village to escape the temptations that arise in civil society. But when he went off to the inhabited desert to live as a hermit, Satan and Co. followed him. To prevent him from becoming holier, they attacked him in every possible way with all sorts of wild visions and even physical violence. When he fasted or prayed more vigorously, they tried to persuade him he was not fasting and praying enough. If he could not be tricked into presumption, they thought they might trick him into despair. Anthony resisted, but it was a lonely fight.</p>\n<p>One day, however, when the hordes of hell had beaten him up within an inch of his life, a ray of light suddenly fell on him from heaven, and the devils took flight.</p>\n<p>Panting, but now at peace, Anthony addressed God, whose presence he sensed in the light. &quot;Where were you my Lord and Master?&quot; he asked, a bit impatiently. &quot;Why didn&apos;t you appear at the beginning to stop my pain?&quot;</p>\n<p>God answered &quot;Anthony, I was right here, but I wanted to see you in action. And now, because you held out and did not surrender, I will ever be your helper, and I will make you renowned everywhere.&quot;</p>\n<p>St. Paul has given us the same assistance of God&apos;s presence: &quot;He will not let you be tested beyond your strength.&quot; (1 Cor. 10:13).

    "markdown": "**The Devil Awaited Another Opportunity**\n\nUnless we realize that Christ was truly man, as well as truly God, we cannot understand how Satan could tempt him. Unless we constantly recall that Satan, rejected once, will try again and again on another opportunity, we cannot appreciate what a persistent nuisance he is.\n\nAll human beings are subjected to temptations. St. Anthony of Egypt is the saint best equipped to be a patron of those tested by Satan. St. Jerome tells us his story.\n\nAnthony, who flourished in the third century, had left his Egyptian village to escape the temptations that arise in civil society. But when he went off to the inhabited desert to live as a hermit, Satan and Co. followed him. To prevent him from becoming holier, they attacked him in every possible way with all sorts of wild visions and even physical violence. When he fasted or prayed more vigorously, they tried to persuade him he was not fasting and praying enough. If he could not be tricked into presumption, they thought they might trick him into despair. Anthony resisted, but it was a lonely fight.\n\nOne day, however, when the hordes of hell had beaten him up within an inch of his life, a ray of light suddenly fell on him from heaven, and the devils took flight.\n\nPanting, but now at peace, Anthony addressed God, whose presence he sensed in the light. \"Where were you my Lord and Master?\" he asked, a bit impatiently. \"Why didn't you appear at the beginning to stop my pain?\"\n\nGod answered \"Anthony, I was right here, but I wanted to see you in action. And now, because you held out and did not surrender, I will ever be your helper, and I will make you renowned everywhere.\"\n\nSt. Paul has given us the same assistance of God's presence: \"He will not let you be tested beyond your strength.\" (1 Cor. 10:13). We must be on guard against Satan, but not afraid of him. God is on our side so long as we are on His. The devil will always prove to be what he really is - a sissy.\n\n\\-Father Robert F.

So when one is &quot;tempted,&quot; it means either that the Evil One is trying to seduce you to disobey God and his laws, or that you are confronted with an &quot;occasion of sin&quot; (e.g., an immoral book, movie or TV show placed in your path by others). &quot;The world, ourselves, or the devil&quot; can be the source of trial or temptation. By itself temptation is not a sin. It becomes &quot;sin&quot; for us only when we permit it to overcome us.</p>\n<p>Whenever you draw apart into your &quot;private desert&quot; - a place to seek God in prayer and fasting - you may well be the object of temptation, just like Jesus was. But the very act of seeking God in prayer and fasting also shows the way that Jesus won his victory over the devil and temptation - by prayer and fasting! It may weaken us physically, as we share in minor, willed deprivations so that we can better understand the major, unwilled suffering of the poor. But it will also strengthen us spiritually, which is the objective, so that we will have our heart and our will disciplined to listen to God&apos;s word for us.

But do you know how to deal with it? Learn about the gift and purpose of Fortitude (CCC #1808). Do you know the benefits of making the sign of the cross (CCC #2157) in times of temptation? Most importantly, if you wish to honor your baptismal promises made to God, you ought to be aware of the helpful ways to remain faithful (CCC #2340). Finally, be aware that Jesus was tempted also, and knows the battles we face (CCC #538-540) and reveals the way to be strengthened for those skirmishes with the Evil One.</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q361: In the gospel today, Jesus calls us to &quot;repent&quot; but doesn&apos;t say &quot;how&quot; to do that.

Every athlete wants the prize - &quot;the Medal.&quot; Gold, Silver, or Bronze, it doesn&apos;t really matter, because winning any one of those will put one&apos;s name in the recordkeeping books forever.

Jesus&apos; first words in public ministry in Mark&apos;s gospel are a call to &quot;change our ways now,&quot; because the reign of God is at hand. No &quot;eternal medal&quot; can be won without conversion, prayer and fasting.

This desire is expressed in prayer and fasting.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Lent is the primary penitential season in the Church year, reminding us of Jesus&apos; forty days of prayer and fasting in the desert. The Tempter certainly tried his best to &quot;distract&quot; and tempt Jesus, but was unsuccessful (CCC #540). When Jesus calls us to &quot;repent&quot; (CCC #541), it is a call to prayer, fasting and almsgiving - holy and traditional ways of acting out our conversion, finding spiritual strength and living the Christian life (CCC #1434). Take temptation seriously; your eternal life is at stake!</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Jesus was Driven into the Desert And Tempted by Satan</strong></p>\n<p>Mark tells us that immediately after his baptism Jesus was driven into the desert where he was confronted by the power of evil. The desert setting is something like that of Adam who was tempted by Satan to indulge himself. But unlike Adam Jesus is not overcome by the temptation. He rejects the lure of self-exaltation, but his struggle does not end there. Throughout his public ministry Jesus attacks the suffering and ignorance that result from sin. His battle with evil ends only on the cross which is his ultimate victory as manifested by his resurrection. As we begin our Lent we are reminded that the Christian life is a constant struggle. We may not confront the obvious and dramatic force of evil, but we do face the temptation to give way to self in small and apparently insignificant ways. We are called to a life of day to day self-giving in imitation of Christ. Lent is the time to renew our commitment to become one with Jesus and his way of life.</p>\n<p><em>Lord God, our Father, send forth your Spirit to guide us in the ways of Your son.

When Jesus calls us to \"repent\" (CCC #541), it is a call to prayer, fasting and almsgiving - holy and traditional ways of acting out our conversion, finding spiritual strength and living the Christian life (CCC #1434). Take temptation seriously; your eternal life is at stake!\n\n---\n\n**Jesus was Driven into the Desert And Tempted by Satan**\n\nMark tells us that immediately after his baptism Jesus was driven into the desert where he was confronted by the power of evil. The desert setting is something like that of Adam who was tempted by Satan to indulge himself. But unlike Adam Jesus is not overcome by the temptation. He rejects the lure of self-exaltation, but his struggle does not end there. Throughout his public ministry Jesus attacks the suffering and ignorance that result from sin. His battle with evil ends only on the cross which is his ultimate victory as manifested by his resurrection. As we begin our Lent we are reminded that the Christian life is a constant struggle. We may not confront the obvious and dramatic force of evil, but we do face the temptation to give way to self in small and apparently insignificant ways. We are called to a life of day to day self-giving in imitation of Christ. Lent is the time to renew our commitment to become one with Jesus and his way of life.\n\n_Lord God, our Father, send forth your Spirit to guide us in the ways of Your son. Help us to take up our cross and follow him to Calvary and the resurrection._",

As St. Paul tells us we ought to give thanks always and for everything we have received from Jesus our Lord. Giving thanks is exactly what the word \"Eucharist\" means.\n\n_Dear Lord, give us the wisdom to know your will and sustain us in our efforts to become what you would have us be. Perfect our faith and increase our love for you above all things._",

On March 24th, he and his fellow pupils released a gaggle of colored balloons filled with helium. They were meant to travel considerable distances, and Jeremy hoped that his would reach Canada. Somebody had promised to give $500 to his school for any balloon that crossed the border. Of course, Jeremy and the rest of the children attached their names and addresses to the balloons so that finders could acknowledge the arrival of the little airborne bubbles.</p>\n<p>Jeremy&apos;s balloon did not come down in Canada; it went much farther. Picked up by the westerly winds, it danced out across the Atlantic, and probably across a good part of western Europe. Then winds from the northwest swept it over the Mediterranean Sea deep into eastern Africa where it finally alighted after a voyage of 8,000 miles.</p>\n<p>Early in May, a letter reached Jeremy signed by a person named Joshua Owino Kilori. &quot;You might have wondered,&quot; said the writer, &quot;where your balloon disappeared to. This sweet yellow balloon traveled thousands of miles to Africa. I found it on a beach in Mombasa. It is in East Africa, a country known as Kenya.&quot; The writer signed himself &quot;Josh.&quot;</p>\n<p>What a nice fantasy to picture Jeremy Cook&apos;s yellow balloon given a joy-ride one-third around the world by kindly winds! Today&apos;s first reading (incidentally from the Book of Joshua) speaks of God&apos;s watchful guidance of his people in almost similar terms: &quot;He protected us along our entire journey and among all the peoples through whom we passed.&quot; How true it is that we travel through life under the shadow of His wings. &quot;Therefore,&quot; we say with Joshua&apos;s Israelites, &quot;we also will serve the Lord, for He is our God.&quot; (Joshua 24:17-18).</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q386: Why would &quot;disciples&quot; of Jesus walk away from his teaching that He was the &quot;bread of life&quot; (Jn 6:60-69)?</strong></p>\n<p>After 2000 years, people are still faced with the same choice! We just returned from a weekend Retreat with other deacon couples at the Retreat Center in Griswold, Iowa. Over and over we heard about God&apos;s incredible love for us, and how he is always present to us in so many different ways. Our task (as St. Ignatius teaches) is to learn to recognize his presence, adore him, love him, be grateful, and carry that love to others. To our great joy and awe, He makes himself present to us daily in the Sacrament of Holy Eucharist.</p>\n<p>Today we hear in the Gospel (Jn 6:60-69) that many could not accept Jesus&apos; words claiming that he was the &quot;Bread of Life&quot; - so they turned away from him. Even some &quot;Christians&quot; (non-Catholics) have difficulty with this, thinking that the Holy Eucharist is &quot;only a symbol&quot; of His Real Presence. After all, they sometimes reason, if the offering of Calvary was sufficient for obtaining salvation for all human beings, then why must Jesus &quot;invent&quot; a new presence in the Christian assembly? (This was also the rhetorical question posed for discussion in Jubilee Year 2000 by a special theological commission at the Vatican in the book, &quot;The Eucharist: Gift of Divine Life.&quot;)</p>\n<p>There could only be one answer: &quot;Everything in the Eucharist derives from love carried to extremes. All emerges from a limitless will to give&quot; (op.cit.). We are talking about a perpetual continuation of the Incarnation! That is the measure of his incredible love for us! As the messenger told Abraham, &quot;Is anything too marvelous for the Lord to do?&quot;( Gen 18:14a). We pray that all will recognize this gift of Sacramental love, and then maybe - like Cleopas, Zacchaeus and others - they, too, will recognize him in the breaking of the bread and come back to him without attempting to limit his power and his love.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> The question Jesus asks his Apostles today is the same question every Christian must answer: &quot;Do you also want to leave?&quot; It is an invitation to discover that to receive in faith the gift of his Eucharist is to receive the Lord himself (CCC #1336).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q542: Isn&#x2019;t it difficult to believe in what is unseen, what we call &#x201C;mystery&#x201D;?</strong></p>\n<p>The readings in the bible are all about choices, aren&#x2019;t they? In the First Reading today (Joshua 24:1-18), Moses has been replaced by the one he laid hands upon in a commissioning ceremony. So now Joshua reminds the people of their need to make a decision and recommit their lives to Yahweh alone. The location is the earliest holy site of the Hebrews, called Shechem. It is directly connected to the patriarch Abraham and the Lord&#x2019;s promise of the land to him and his descendants. Joshua&#x2019;s choice of commitment to Yahweh is unconditional: he and his household will serve the Lord.</p>\n<p>In the Gospel (John 6:60-69) we find the same situation: a critical moment of decision. Does the crowd want to exploit Jesus, or enter into a trusting relationship with him? Jesus is asking his disciples to look beyond the signs of the bread which he fed miraculously to thousands, and see the reality to which it points: his divine origin. You can discern according to the flesh, which is the shallow human way. If you do, you will turn away from Jesus in unbelief. The other choice is to discern according to the spirit, which means you will respond with a faith that believes in everything Jesus says or does. To make the right choice means that you have accepted the gift of faith from the Father in heaven.</p>\n<p>Jesus puts the question squarely to the apostles: are you going to leave, like those unbelievers who turned away? Peter the Rock is the one who speaks for the apostles. He not only affirms their trust in the words of Jesus; he also identifies the very origin of Jesus as coming from God himself &#x2013; a sure sign of faith.</p>\n<p>If we truly believe in the incarnation, that Jesus is the Son of God, then how can we possibly consider following anyone but Jesus? Why do we put up roadblocks to his word becoming alive and fruitful in our own lives? Are we truly looking beyond the signs, to the underlying reality about the divinity of Christ &#x2013; and the demand that places upon us?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> The Eucharist and the Cross are always stumbling blocks for those who discern according to the flesh. It is the spirit that gives life to the flesh. Jesus invites us to discover that he alone has &#x201C;the words of eternal life&#x201D; (CCC #1336). Listen to him, act on his word, and receive eternal life. Rest in the mystery!</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Decisions, Decisions, Decisions</strong></p>\n<p>Today&apos;s readings call us to renewal and re-consecration when we face difficult decisions or commitments. The people of Israel were changing from a life as nomadic shepherds to a life as settled farmers. But could the God of the desert meet their needs under these new circumstances? Joshua calls for a decision: &quot;As for me and my house we will serve the Lord.&quot; Israel answers, &quot;We will also serve the Lord for he is our God.&quot; In the Gospel Jesus calls for his followers to eat his body and drink his blood. Some respond, &quot;This kind of talk is hard to endure. How can anyone take it seriously?&quot; and they leave him He asks the Twelve, &quot;Do you want to leave me too?&quot; Peter answers for all: &quot;Lord to whom shall we go?

In her wheelchair she joined the procession of more than 40,000 pilgrims, and then bathed in the pool beside the grotto. After bathing, she complained of being very tired. At three o&apos;clock the next morning, she awakened in her hotel room. On a sudden impulse she got out of bed and walked. Apart from painful efforts to use crutches, she had never in her life done this. The other pilgrims at the hotel were amazed to see Annick come down the stairs for breakfast. Doctors who examined her on October 8 could find no medical explanation for her recovery. Of course, the medical bureau at Lourdes is very cautious about pronouncing cures miraculous. Conclusions are reached only after several years of observation.</p>\n<p>Naturally everybody was interested in asking Annick&apos;s own reactions. Many knew that she had long since accepted her disability as the will of God.</p>\n<p>&quot;It means joy&quot; she answered, &quot;but also sadness. For I ask myself, why me and not the others?&quot; ...Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? (Romans, 11:34. Today&apos;s second reading).</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q333: I sense a difference between &#x201C;confessing belief in Jesus&#x201D; and &#x201C;witnessing.&#x201D; Is there a difference in usage between Protestants and Catholics?</strong></p>\n<p>Have you ever personally made a public, vocal expression of your belief in Jesus Christ? I am not talking about liturgical settings, with the &#x201C;canned&#x201D; prayers, responses, and creeds that may not always reflect the real attitude of your heart. I am talking about sharing with someone about who you think Jesus really is, and what that means to you. &#x201C;Witnessing&#x201D; in the usual sense means verbally testifying from your heart specifically about what God has done in your life, and how that makes you feel and act. Our non-Catholic evangelical brothers and sisters put us Catholics to shame in this regard. They do not hesitate to publicly &#x201C;confess&#x201D; their faith in Jesus. They are also fearless about &#x201C;witnessing&#x201D; about Jesus - a subsequent act which naturally follows a confession of belief (and this is a quality sorely needed by each and every Catholic).</p>\n<p>Most of us &#x201C;cradle Catholics&#x201D; take our Christianity for granted &#x2013; meaning our belief that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. For that reason, Catholics tend to &quot;opt&quot; for the silent witness of their life, as guided by the teachings of Jesus Christ and his Church. But Catholics excel at witnessing about &#x201C;the rock,&#x201D; the leadership instituted by Jesus himself for the necessary stability of authority and doctrine in the Church he established. We also firmly believe that this &#x201C;rock&#x201D; is more than just the simple confession of faith itself (which is what our Protestant brothers and sisters believe). Clearly it is more, because Jesus gives to the newly-named Peter (&#x201C;Rock&#x201D;), and to Peter alone, the &#x201C;keys&#x201D; (Matt 16:13-20) &#x2013; which in scripture unquestionably means the authority of the giver of the keys and the attendant responsibilities. This is also clearly illustrated in the First Reading where the authority as chief steward or majordomo passes to another by means of the symbol of passing on the &#x201C;key&#x201D; of the House of David (Is 22:19-23).</p>\n<p>This authority and leadership given by Christ to Peter has been passed on ever since then, to the next Bishop of Rome who succeeds him. We call this anointed person the Pope (Greek = papa, therefore a father-figure of authority).</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong><strong> </strong>The Lord made Peter the &#x201C;rock&#x201D; of his Church, and gave him the keys which made him the shepherd of the whole flock (CCC #881). After the resurrection and Pentecost, Peter confessed and proclaimed Jesus&#x2019; messianic kingship to the People of God (CCC #440). Each member of the flock (= the laity) is established and empowered with the mission of witnessing and leading others to faith, both by word and the testimony of their lives (CCC #904-5). Witnessing is not an option; it is a command!</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q490: I&#x2019;m not sure that I really understand how Catholics claim that the Pope has more authority than anyone else in the Church, using today&#x2019;s Gospel.</strong></p>\n<p>To really understand the &#x201C;flavor&#x201D; and beauty of today&#x2019;s Gospel (Matthew 16:13-20), in which Jesus gives Peter primacy over all the other disciples (then and now), we have to see what St. Matthew has done with the story. He has placed it right in between two other stories which are not complimentary to Peter.</p>\n<p>First of all, a couple of weeks ago we heard about Peter trying to respond to Jesus by &#x201C;walking on water,&#x201D; and his weak faith was not up to the event. Next Sunday we will hear Jesus call Peter a &#x201C;Satan&#x201D; to show how Peter was interfering with God&#x2019;s work (Peter was trusting in his own personal opinions). And right in-between those two wonderful stories, he inserts today&#x2019;s gospel story where Jesus says, &#x201C;I will give YOU [Peter only, because the word is in the singular] the keys to the kingdom of heaven.&#x201D; Wow! Talk about a miracle! God always seems to pick the most insignificant person, and elevate him to greatness. (Recall the summer Olympics this year (2008): was this not the case with the personal history of the great swimmer, Michael Phelps?)</p>\n<p>Catholics believe that this authority given to Peter alone was not meant to &#x201C;die&#x201D; with him. Instead, it was passed on to the subsequent patriarchs/popes of Rome. That is why we have complete trust in the Teaching Office of the Church: it has the official recognition of Jesus Christ himself, the One who started it all!</p>\n<p>It is only through Jesus, and through his chosen &#x201C;holder of the keys&#x201D; that we will find true Unity. They may have personal and sinful faults. But in teachings on faith and morals, they cannot lead us astray, since they have the Holy Spirit to guide them to the end of time. If you have trouble with Rome, with the official teachings of the popes, then it is time to &#x201C;rethink&#x201D; your position. If you continue your opposition, in the face of the evidence, you will find yourself fighting against the Holy Spirit. Good Luck!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> The Lord made Peter alone the &#x201C;rock&#x201D; of his Church, and gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the whole flock (CCC #881). This pastoral office is continued by the bishops under the primacy of the Pope.</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>My Thoughts are not Your Thoughts</strong></p>\n<p>We will hear these words in the liturgy a few weeks from now, but they are also a fitting reflection on today&apos;s gospel. Jesus picks Simon Peter to receive the keys to his kingdom. Who would have thought it! Just two weeks ago we heard Jesus marvel at Peter&apos;s weak faith and next week we will hear Jesus rebuke Peter as Satan! Why would Jesus pick Peter? Why can fathom the plan of God? But could it be that even though his foot is often in his mouth, Peter&apos;s heart is in the right place? He does have faith, weak as it may sometimes seem, and that is at the heart of what Peter becomes: the rock. His faith is based on is certitude about who Jesus is. It is a faith expressed in his total commitment to the person of Jesus: &quot;Lord, to whom shall we go, we have come to believe that you have the words of life.</p>\n<p><em>Lord Jesus, our faith is not always what it should be. Like Peter we sometimes jump to conclusions and do stupid things. Like him we don&apos;t always see things your way. Help us like Peter, to repent and turn back to you. &quot;Lord we do believe; help our lack of faith.&quot;</em></p> \n\t\t",

Witnessing is not an option; it is a command!\n\n---\n\n**Q490: I’m not sure that I really understand how Catholics claim that the Pope has more authority than anyone else in the Church, using today’s Gospel.**\n\nTo really understand the “flavor” and beauty of today’s Gospel (Matthew 16:13-20), in which Jesus gives Peter primacy over all the other disciples (then and now), we have to see what St. Matthew has done with the story. He has placed it right in between two other stories which are not complimentary to Peter.\n\nFirst of all, a couple of weeks ago we heard about Peter trying to respond to Jesus by “walking on water,” and his weak faith was not up to the event. Next Sunday we will hear Jesus call Peter a “Satan” to show how Peter was interfering with God’s work (Peter was trusting in his own personal opinions). And right in-between those two wonderful stories, he inserts today’s gospel story where Jesus says, “I will give YOU \\[Peter only, because the word is in the singular\\] the keys to the kingdom of heaven.” Wow! Talk about a miracle! God always seems to pick the most insignificant person, and elevate him to greatness. (Recall the summer Olympics this year (2008): was this not the case with the personal history of the great swimmer, Michael Phelps?)\n\nCatholics believe that this authority given to Peter alone was not meant to “die” with him. Instead, it was passed on to the subsequent patriarchs/popes of Rome. That is why we have complete trust in the Teaching Office of the Church: it has the official recognition of Jesus Christ himself, the One who started it all!\n\nIt is only through Jesus, and through his chosen “holder of the keys” that we will find true Unity. They may have personal and sinful faults. But in teachings on faith and morals, they cannot lead us astray, since they have the Holy Spirit to guide them to the end of time. If you have trouble with Rome, with the official teachings of the popes, then it is time to “rethink” your position. If you continue your opposition, in the face of the evidence, you will find yourself fighting against the Holy Spirit. Good Luck!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The Lord made Peter alone the “rock” of his Church, and gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the whole flock (CCC #881). This pastoral office is continued by the bishops under the primacy of the Pope.\n\n---\n\n**My Thoughts are not Your Thoughts**\n\nWe will hear these words in the liturgy a few weeks from now, but they are also a fitting reflection on today's gospel. Jesus picks Simon Peter to receive the keys to his kingdom. Who would have thought it! Just two weeks ago we heard Jesus marvel at Peter's weak faith and next week we will hear Jesus rebuke Peter as Satan! Why would Jesus pick Peter? Why can fathom the plan of God? But could it be that even though his foot is often in his mouth, Peter's heart is in the right place? He does have faith, weak as it may sometimes seem, and that is at the heart of what Peter becomes: the rock. His faith is based on is certitude about who Jesus is. It is a faith expressed in his total commitment to the person of Jesus: \"Lord, to whom shall we go, we have come to believe that you have the words of life.\n\n_Lord Jesus, our faith is not always what it should be. Like Peter we sometimes jump to conclusions and do stupid things. Like him we don't always see things your way. Help us like Peter, to repent and turn back to you. \"Lord we do believe; help our lack of faith.\"_",

Today&apos;s first reading.)</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q387: Is St. James overly concerned that people can deceive themselves through mere ritual observance?</strong></p>\n<p>One of those &quot;universal&quot; things that everyone in the world does, at one time or another, is to go &quot;window shopping.&quot; We just want to &quot;browse&quot; without buying anything. Maybe there is a little bit of envy in the deep recesses of our mind, as we look at the things we can&apos;t afford. Maybe there is also a little bit of fantasy, as we picture ourselves in that latest designer outfit or trendy set of sports clothes. Or maybe we are just curious to see what the manufacturers are doing to appeal to our consumer lust for &quot;more&quot; of something we don&apos;t need. Or, maybe we are the reluctant spouse or child, forced to tag along as our wife or mother indulges her own fantasies.</p>\n<p>Now, let&apos;s move that symbolism to the area of religion. Consider your own expression of faith on Sundays. Are you a &quot;window shopper,&quot; just tagging along or showing up because someone says you &quot;have to&quot;? Or, perhaps you are attending Sunday worship services just hoping to be entertained by a lively homily? Is it possible that you wore that outfit just to show off the latest fashions and get lots of attention? After Mass is over, is the gospel message and homily suggestion forgotten? (Can you even dimly remember what the preacher recommended last Sunday?)</p>\n<p>St. James is urging us today in the second reading (James 1:17-27) to avoid the danger of being simply a &quot;Christian window shopper.&quot; God&apos;s word is not entertainment; it is both call and invitation to a special way of life - God&apos;s way. We are called to be &quot;doers&quot; of the word, not just window shoppers who won&apos;t take action on what they see and hear.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> If our hearts are open, God&apos;s word will cause us to take action out of love, not from ritual demands (CCC #1972). Our only &quot;law&quot; is to love as Christ loved us - this is the &quot;new&quot; law of the Holy Spirit (CCC #782). Letting God&apos;s word take root and grow through action is how we avoid the self-deception that concerns St. James.</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q543: So what is wrong with a good hand washing before meals? It makes sense; why would Jesus object to the practice (Mark 7:1-23)?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m sure that everyone has been in a room or an elevator with a group of people, and one person is reeking overwhelmingly from old-fashioned B.O. Sometimes it can be downright awful or disgusting, and challenge your ability to keep an expressionless face. As soon as you can do so without embarrassing the other person, you find an excuse to move to another location. It isn&#x2019;t easy to find a way to tell a friend (or even a stranger) that they really stink, or that they need to try a new deodorant. Over the years, most people have developed the defensive habit of hiding such potential embarrassments, by disguising their problem through the use of a deodorant once or twice a day.</p>\n<p>The Israelites had also developed a defensive habit or custom, one not required by the written Torah or Mosaic law. The cultic priests received their portion of food from the sacrificial offerings at the Temple. So to avoid offending God and to stay ritually pure, these priests had a defensive water ritual of cleansing the hands and forearms, to avoid any possibility of appearing awful or disgusting before the presence of God in the Temple. Soon the people simply copied what the priests were doing, urged on by oral teachings that in due course became part of the human tradition perpetuated by the scribes and Pharisees.</p>\n<p>The problem Jesus confronted arose because this human tradition had come to be viewed as a mandate from God, which was not true. No longer was the cleansing or washing action related to its original purpose as a desire to avoid being insensitive to God&#x2019;s presence. It had become just a rigid practice to follow. Jesus refused to follow a set of rules that were aimed a judging others and which became a source of class division (i.e., clean rich vs. unclean poor).</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>The novel interpretation by Jesus of some of the details of the oral law regarding purity were seen as religious crimes by those rigidly adhering to human rather than divine traditions (CCC #574). Jesus disavowed such human traditions by his own divine authority (CCC #581).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Be Doers of the Word</strong></p>\n<p>The first reading today puts great stress on keeping God&apos;s commandments. It tells us to add nothing to them. In the centuries after Moses people developed many traditional interpretations and ways of understanding the commandments. Sometimes their concern for keeping these human traditions and interpretations distracted them from more important and essential aspects of God&apos;s commands. In today&apos;s Gospel Jesus is angry at this nitpicking over interpretations and rigid observances. He tells them to focus on more substantial matters. He makes his point later in Mark&apos;s Gospel by quoting from other Old Testament passages: &quot;Hear, O Israel, The Lord is our God, the Lord alone! Therefore you shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and soul. and your neighbor as your self.&quot; St. James reminds us: &quot;Be doers of the word. Act on this word. If all you do is listen&#x2026;you are deceiving yourself.&quot; He tells us that the way to observe God&apos;s command is &quot;Looking after widows and orphans&#x2026;&quot; These were the biblical images of the defenseless and needy whom we are to love as ourselves.</p>\n<p><em>Lord you have given us the task of building your creation into a world of love and justice. May your words inspire all our actions and sustain them to the end, so that all our prayer and work may begin in you and be completed through your help.</em></p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

Or maybe we are just curious to see what the manufacturers are doing to appeal to our consumer lust for \"more\" of something we don't need. Or, maybe we are the reluctant spouse or child, forced to tag along as our wife or mother indulges her own fantasies.\n\nNow, let's move that symbolism to the area of religion. Consider your own expression of faith on Sundays. Are you a \"window shopper,\" just tagging along or showing up because someone says you \"have to\"? Or, perhaps you are attending Sunday worship services just hoping to be entertained by a lively homily? Is it possible that you wore that outfit just to show off the latest fashions and get lots of attention? After Mass is over, is the gospel message and homily suggestion forgotten? (Can you even dimly remember what the preacher recommended last Sunday?)\n\nSt. James is urging us today in the second reading (James 1:17-27) to avoid the danger of being simply a \"Christian window shopper.\" God's word is not entertainment; it is both call and invitation to a special way of life - God's way. We are called to be \"doers\" of the word, not just window shoppers who won't take action on what they see and hear.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** If our hearts are open, God's word will cause us to take action out of love, not from ritual demands (CCC #1972). Our only \"law\" is to love as Christ loved us - this is the \"new\" law of the Holy Spirit (CCC #782). Letting God's word take root and grow through action is how we avoid the self-deception that concerns St. James.\n\n---\n\n**Q543: So what is wrong with a good hand washing before meals? It makes sense; why would Jesus object to the practice (Mark 7:1-23)?**\n\nI’m sure that everyone has been in a room or an elevator with a group of people, and one person is reeking overwhelmingly from old-fashioned B.O. Sometimes it can be downright awful or disgusting, and challenge your ability to keep an expressionless face. As soon as you can do so without embarrassing the other person, you find an excuse to move to another location. It isn’t easy to find a way to tell a friend (or even a stranger) that they really stink, or that they need to try a new deodorant. Over the years, most people have developed the defensive habit of hiding such potential embarrassments, by disguising their problem through the use of a deodorant once or twice a day.\n\nThe Israelites had also developed a defensive habit or custom, one not required by the written Torah or Mosaic law. The cultic priests received their portion of food from the sacrificial offerings at the Temple. So to avoid offending God and to stay ritually pure, these priests had a defensive water ritual of cleansing the hands and forearms, to avoid any possibility of appearing awful or disgusting before the presence of God in the Temple. Soon the people simply copied what the priests were doing, urged on by oral teachings that in due course became part of the human tradition perpetuated by the scribes and Pharisees.\n\nThe problem Jesus confronted arose because this human tradition had come to be viewed as a mandate from God, which was not true. No longer was the cleansing or washing action related to its original purpose as a desire to avoid being insensitive to God’s presence. It had become just a rigid practice to follow. Jesus refused to follow a set of rules that were aimed a judging others and which became a source of class division (i.e., clean rich vs. unclean poor).\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The novel interpretation by Jesus of some of the details of the oral law regarding purity were seen as religious crimes by those rigidly adhering to human rather than divine traditions (CCC #574). Jesus disavowed such human traditions by his own divine authority (CCC #581).\n\n---\n\n**Be Doers of the Word**\n\nThe first reading today puts great stress on keeping God's commandments. It tells us to add nothing to them. In the centuries after Moses people developed many traditional interpretations and ways of understanding the commandments. Sometimes their concern for keeping these human traditions and interpretations distracted them from more important and essential aspects of God's commands. In today's Gospel Jesus is angry at this nitpicking over interpretations and rigid observances. He tells them to focus on more substantial matters. He makes his point later in Mark's Gospel by quoting from other Old Testament passages: \"Hear, O Israel, The Lord is our God, the Lord alone! Therefore you shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and soul. and your neighbor as your self.\" St. James reminds us: \"Be doers of the word. Act on this word. If all you do is listen…you are deceiving yourself.\" He tells us that the way to observe God's command is \"Looking after widows and orphans…\" These were the biblical images of the defenseless and needy whom we are to love as ourselves.\n\n_Lord you have given us the task of building your creation into a world of love and justice. May your words inspire all our actions and sustain them to the end, so that all our prayer and work may begin in you and be completed through your help._",

Think before you respond.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Today Christ continues to touch us and heal us in the Sacraments – visible signs of invisible grace (CCC #1504). Have faith, and trust in our Savior’s words and actions.\n\n---\n\n**Ephphatha Be Opened**\n\nThe prophet Isaiah told the Israelites that the coming of God's kingdom would be marked by great miracles and signs: \"the eyes of the blind will see…the ears of the deaf will be opened…\" Today we see Jesus preaching the coming of that kingdom not only in words but in his actions. He cures the deaf man but tells him to tell no one! He doesn't want to be seen just as a wonder worker, a media personality. He wants people to listen to his message and to act on it. As St. James told us last week, \"be doers of the word and not just hearers…\" In today's reading he shows what that means in a very practical way. So too when Jesus comes into our midst in the Eucharist, he wants our ears to be opened to his commands, to be doers as well as listeners.\n\n_Lord, open my eyes to see as you see, open my ears to hear your words, and give me the strength to follow your path and be your instrument in securing justice for the oppressed and food for the hungry._",

But apart from having famous kith and kin, Sarah achieved a bit of glory on her own as the author of a catchy little epigram.</p>\n<p>A few years before her death in 1953 she wrote these wise and witty lines which all of all would do well to remember and act on:</p>\n<p>Every day I pass the church,<br>\n\tI stop and make a visit,<br>\n\tFor fear that when I&apos;m carried there<br>\n\tThe Lord will say, &quot;Who is it?</p>\n<p>&quot; ...Remember your last days, set enmity aside; remember death and decay and cease from sin!&quot; (Sirach, 28; 6 Today&apos;s first reading)</p>\n<p>If your day is hemmed with prayer, it is less likely to unravel.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F.

Is there a way to break open the meaning intended by Jesus?</strong></p>\n<p>Several years ago a preacher friend named Mark Whittaker (ecumenical preachers network called PRCL) said something that always stuck with me. He asked this question: If Ed McMahon came to your door with a check for $11 million dollars, how would you say &#x201C;thank you&#x201D;? Is something more required than just jumping up and down for the cameras?</p>\n<p>If you think about it, just how do you say a meaningful &#x201C;thank you&#x201D; to someone who has saved your life? Or is it just impossible to express your feelings in a way that would seem to &#x201C;match&#x201D; the gift itself? Look at the Crucifix in your church and in your home (if you don&#x2019;t have one, are you sure you are a Christian?). That simply represents a most incredible and unrepeatable gift, the gift of eternal life. The Crucifix is &quot;the&quot; sign of our eternal salvation! Yes, eternal salvation! Just how do you say &#x201C;thanks&#x201D; to a gift like that?!</p>\n<p>We Americans tend to think in terms of &#x201C;obligations&#x201D; -- we were invited to a great party, now we feel &#x201C;obligated&#x201D; to pay them back&#x2026; we were given a great birthday gift, now we have to match it in return&#x2026; Oh, you dumb Americans (that includes me)! We need to learn simply to accept the gift with love, with no strings attached, with no obligations.

Jesus forgave us our sins, paying a terrible price for our sinfulness, showing the depth of his love for his brothers and sisters.

No, but Sirach didn&apos;t say we are sinners for feeling that way, but for &quot;holding on to them,&quot; for &quot;nourishing those feelings.

    "markdown": "**Keeping up a nodding acquaintance**\n\nSarah Hewit Frier was the niece of Father Augustine Hewit, C.S.P., associate founder, in 1858, of the famous American religious order, the Paulist Fathers. Through her Paulist connection, she became acquainted, as a girl, with the great American convert, journalist and philosopher, Orestes A. Brownson. But apart from having famous kith and kin, Sarah achieved a bit of glory on her own as the author of a catchy little epigram.\n\nA few years before her death in 1953 she wrote these wise and witty lines which all of all would do well to remember and act on:\n\nEvery day I pass the church,  \nI stop and make a visit,  \nFor fear that when I'm carried there  \nThe Lord will say, \"Who is it?\n\n\" ...Remember your last days, set enmity aside; remember death and decay and cease from sin!\" (Sirach, 28; 6 Today's first reading)\n\nIf your day is hemmed with prayer, it is less likely to unravel.\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q336: To “forgive” another 77 times (Mt 18:21-35) seems to be an exaggeration. Is there a way to break open the meaning intended by Jesus?**\n\nSeveral years ago a preacher friend named Mark Whittaker (ecumenical preachers network called PRCL) said something that always stuck with me. He asked this question: If Ed McMahon came to your door with a check for $11 million dollars, how would you say “thank you”? Is something more required than just jumping up and down for the cameras?\n\nIf you think about it, just how do you say a meaningful “thank you” to someone who has saved your life? Or is it just impossible to express your feelings in a way that would seem to “match” the gift itself? Look at the Crucifix in your church and in your home (if you don’t have one, are you sure you are a Christian?). That simply represents a most incredible and unrepeatable gift, the gift of eternal life. The Crucifix is \"the\" sign of our eternal salvation! Yes, eternal salvation! Just how do you say “thanks” to a gift like that?!\n\nWe Americans tend to think in terms of “obligations” -- we were invited to a great party, now we feel “obligated” to pay them back… we were given a great birthday gift, now we have to match it in return… Oh, you dumb Americans (that includes me)! We need to learn simply to accept the gift with love, with no strings attached, with no obligations. And it is out of that very same love that we do, in fact, respond in kind with as much love as we can muster for the purpose.\n\nGod has forgiven us for all of our sins. What is our response? There is no way we can “repay” him for his free gift of love. But if our hearts are tuned in correctly, we will learn that love freely given drives us to give it away. Jesus forgave us our sins, paying a terrible price for our sinfulness, showing the depth of his love for his brothers and sisters. Now that very same gift calls us to give away - in imitation of Jesus – all of the love and forgiveness we have in our hearts, gifts to be passed on to others. “77 times” means Jesus wants it all – all the forgiveness in our hearts, all of the gratitude, all of the love -- gifts he gave us for the simple purpose of passing them on as his disciples.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The gates of forgiveness are always open to anyone who turns away from sin (CCC #982). Everyone must be tireless in forgiving each other both the petty and the serious; the charity of Christ demands it (CCC #2227). It is our own heart that binds us to heaven or hell, just like the “merciless servant” found out in today’s gospel (CCC #2843).\n\n---\n\n**Forgive Us Our Trespasses as we Forgive Those who Trespass Against Us.**\n\nToday's readings sound like a commentary on the Lord's Prayer. How many times do we really think about the meaning of those words as we say them? Jesus tells us we must always forgive. Doesn't it sometimes seem as if God is unreasonable, as when Sirach tells us \"anger and wrath are hateful things.\" Can we really help the way we feel in the face of hurt and injustice? No, but Sirach didn't say we are sinners for feeling that way, but for \"holding on to them,\" for \"nourishing those feelings.

For centuries this tender name has been applied to priests in religious orders. Our American Catholic custom of calling diocesan priests by the same term is scarcely a century old. But it is equally appropriate - never more so than when we are addressing priests who baptized us. In a very special way they are our spiritual parents. That is why St. Paul, in today&apos;s second reading, calls the slave Onesimus who he had recently baptized &quot;my child whom I have begotten.&quot;</p>\n<p>The Catholic priesthood has had a rough time in America over the past twenty years. Not a few &quot;fathers&quot; have left its service. The number of aspirants to the priesthood has plummeted. (This is true, at least, in the Western World; in Iron Curtain lands and in the Third World, the number of vocations is rising dramatically). Part of the fault is ours. Forgetful of what priests mean to us, we have too often neglected to praise the priesthood in our homes. Thus our sons never think of priesthood as a great and wonderful vocation to which they, too, are possibly called.</p>\n<p>Recently a Connecticut woman spoke out, albeit anonymously, in praise of priests. Her letter appeared in the Hartford Catholic Transcript.</p>\n<p>&quot;Dear Fathers, brothers, but most of all, priests in Christ, we who have been blessed so much of our lives, to have been fed, consoled and cared for by so many of you, want to say over and over again how grateful we are to God and to you for your compassion, love, and all that you have done for us. We hope that you know how much we love and need you in these dark hours in our world and in our Church! We realize today that you are fewer in number, and we are sorry to have added our heavy burden to those you already bear. Please forgive us&#x2026;Surely you must know how much your family (your church family) needs you to help to reap the harvest of so many lost souls in our world today. There are so many hungers that need to be filled. With His help, and yours, we know this can be done.&quot;</p>\n<p>Our priests needed that word of acknowledgement. Thanks, Mrs. Calabash, whoever you are!</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q283: In our Second Reading today (Phlm 1:9-17), Paul sends the runaway slave Onesimus back to his legal owner, Philemon. Is this his way of saying that slavery is &quot;okay&quot; for Christians?</strong></p>\n<p>After the customary &quot;greetings&quot; and &quot;farewells,&quot; this tiny letter has only twelve verses to make its message heard. And it reflects Jesus&apos; own methods when it came to challenging the cultural &quot;standards&quot; of a &quot;status society&quot; (called an &quot;honor-shame&quot; society) such as the Mediterranean world of those days, when those standards impinged upon the dignity of humans.</p>\n<p>The message is extremely potent and powerful, yet masterful in its subtle approach. Paul and Philemon live in a world where legal rights were dictated by a military power, such that one could not safely challenge the social structure and survive. So Paul is forced to appeal to Christian love: when it comes to the Christian community, we are to treat each other as blood brother and sister, not as a caste system of master and slave. That is a direct challenge to the existing cultural standards, because the slave owner is being asked &quot;in the name of (Christian) love&quot; to treat Onesimus as a beloved brother. Slavery as an institution is not even a direct issue; the human dignity of the slave Onesimus is the issue, as well as the response demanded by any and every Christian in such a situation.</p>\n<p>That is a very high price for a slave owner to pay, in a society structured around honor and shame, where &quot;control&quot; was the top priority to preserve the status quo. Today is one of those rare Sundays when the Second Reading fits so perfectly, although unintentionally, with the Gospel (Lk 14:25-33). Jesus spells out very clearly the high price a committed Christian may be called to pay to follow him -- even at the cost of breaking with family and social structures that might insert barriers between humans who are equal in God&apos;s eyes.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!&#xA0; </strong>The name &quot;Onesimus&quot; means &quot;profitable&quot; in Greek, and our Church teaches with utmost clarity that it is a sin against the dignity of persons to reduce them to their productive value or to a source of profit (CCC #2414). Paul was laying the foundation for social advocacy to help those powerless to help themselves. What have you done to improve social justice concerns in your city?</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q440: The ending Gospel verse is very frightening for me (Luke 14:33). Why do I have to give up everything I own and become materially poor, to become a disciple?</strong></p>\n<p>Quick answer: you don&#x2019;t! When most folks hear the phrase about renouncing their &#x201C;possessions,&#x201D; they usually picture their retirement savings, their new car, home, and other kinds of property. Visions of living like a homeless street person or vagrant bring on the goose bumps.

No longer is &#x201C;social status&#x201D; an important guideline and goal. Instead, an uncompromising loyalty to Jesus &#x2013; demonstrated today by an unconditional acceptance of his teachings, those proclaimed to us by our Catholic bishops &#x2013; is the sole criterion to true discipleship. In this kind of kingdom envisioned by Jesus, we renounce the attitude that drives us to seek and cling to greater social status, and we refocus our attention on loving God and loving all his children. In this kind of kingdom, everyone has the same status &#x2013; not the social kind, but the greatest status of all: the knowledge that I belong to God&#x2019;s household, that I am one of His kingdom kids.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Our bond with Jesus takes absolute precedence over all other bonds, familial or social (CCC #1618).

It takes a gift from God to see and accept the fact that God&apos;s ways turn our expectations on their heads. A slave owner does not take back a runaway and treat him like brother, but that is what Paul asks of Philemon to do in the name of Christ. Jesus tells us to hate our parents, spouse, and children. He doesn&apos;t mean that literally, of course, but goes to show how high a price early Christians had to pay for being his disciples.

Born in what is now Hungary, and originally a soldier (though he disliked soldiering), Martin eventually came to Gaul and founded the monastery of Liguge. Ten years later he had acquired such good repute that the people of Tours demanded him for their bishop. As bishop of Tours he became widely noted for his piety, his tireless missionary efforts among the pagans of the countryside, and his labors as an international churchman.</p>\n<p>When he was about eighty, Bishop Martin had a knowledge that death was drawing near, and he announced it to his disciples. With tears in their eyes, they begged him not to leave them. Torn between his desire for heaven and his desire to serve his flock, he prayed to God, &quot;Lord, if your people still need me I will not refuse the task. Your will be done!&quot; God did not change the schedule. The fatal illness attacked Martin soon after, while he was visiting a remote part of his diocese. But he had left the decision up to God.</p>\n<p>&quot;...I long to be freed from this life and to be with Christ, for that is the far better thing; yet it is more urgent that I remain alive for your sakes.&quot; (Philippians, 1, 23-24. Today&apos;s second reading.)</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q337: Can you make a connection for me between the First Reading (Isaiah 55:6-9 &#x2013; seeking the Lord) and the Gospel (Mt 20:1-16a &#x2013; the vineyard workers)? There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a link between the two.</strong></p>\n<p>When King David was dying, he told his son, &#x201C;If you seek the Lord, he will let himself be found by you&#x201D; (1 Chron 28:9b). Shortly after that, the Lord appeared to new king Solomon, and told him that no matter how bad things might get, if the people &#x201C;seek my presence and turn from their evil ways, I will hear them from heaven and pardon their sins&#x201D; (2 Chron 7:14b). Now, 400 years later, we hear the prophet Isaiah in the First Reading (Is 55:6-9) urging the Jewish people in Exile &#x2013; who are experiencing how bad it can get &#x2013; to &#x201C;seek the Lord.&#x201D; And the Psalmist today stresses &#x201C;The Lord is near to all who call upon him&#x201D; (Ps 145:18).</p>\n<p>Why do the people seek the Lord? In most cases, they are in a bad situation, and they cry out for his mercy and compassion. That is the link. God&#x2019;s holiness will not tolerate sin; therefore, you always see &#x201C;conditions&#x201D; (or better, &quot;prerequisites&quot;) to a true relationship with Him -- such as the call to &#x201C;forsake&#x201D; wicked ways, &#x201C;turn&#x201D; from evil ways, and in New Testament times, &#x201C;repent&#x201D; &#x2013; actions which show a humbled heart open to God.</p>\n<p>In our Gospel story (Mt 20:1-16a), we hear the parable of the Vineyard Workers. Notice that the &#x201C;owner&#x201D; of the vineyard &#x2013; God &#x2013; goes out himself to find the unemployed workers, rather than the other way around. He treats all equally, no matter how late the hour, demonstrating his compassion and mercy to those without dignity. Such is the way of our God with sinners. God is always inviting us to return to his vineyard, and find meaning in a restored relationship with our merciful Creator. He is inviting us to seek Him, and to be assured that He will let himself be found!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM</strong>! We ask the Mother of Mercy to pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death &#x2013; this humbly acknowledges that we are indeed sinners seeking God&#x2019;s mercy (CCC #2677). God desires mercy from us also, not sacrifice (CCC #2100). Therefore we must imitate Jesus, and desire to perform works of mercy (CCC #2447) like a true disciple.</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>It Isn&apos;t Fair!</strong></p>\n<p>I suspect that this is the immediate reaction of many people on hearing this parable from today&apos;s gospel. We live in a society which is very touchy about justice, about giving individuals their rights. That&apos;s probably why we have so many lawsuits. But Isaiah tells us today that our ways are not God&apos;s ways. God&apos;s ways are far beyond our comprehension, yet we are called to follow God&apos;s ways. If God dealt with us in strict justice, we&apos;d be in a bad way, so we should be glad that his ways are different. He forgives where we would demand our pound of flesh. He gives freely, out of love, what we have not earned, a gift, not payment for service.

    "markdown": "**Willing Service**\n\nThe chief apostle of Gaul (that is ancient France) was the fourth-century missionary-bishop, St. Martin of Tours. Born in what is now Hungary, and originally a soldier (though he disliked soldiering), Martin eventually came to Gaul and founded the monastery of Liguge. Ten years later he had acquired such good repute that the people of Tours demanded him for their bishop. As bishop of Tours he became widely noted for his piety, his tireless missionary efforts among the pagans of the countryside, and his labors as an international churchman.\n\nWhen he was about eighty, Bishop Martin had a knowledge that death was drawing near, and he announced it to his disciples. With tears in their eyes, they begged him not to leave them. Torn between his desire for heaven and his desire to serve his flock, he prayed to God, \"Lord, if your people still need me I will not refuse the task. Your will be done!\" God did not change the schedule. The fatal illness attacked Martin soon after, while he was visiting a remote part of his diocese. But he had left the decision up to God.\n\n\"...I long to be freed from this life and to be with Christ, for that is the far better thing; yet it is more urgent that I remain alive for your sakes.\" (Philippians, 1, 23-24. Today's second reading.)\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q337: Can you make a connection for me between the First Reading (Isaiah 55:6-9 – seeking the Lord) and the Gospel (Mt 20:1-16a – the vineyard workers)? There doesn’t seem to be a link between the two.**\n\nWhen King David was dying, he told his son, “If you seek the Lord, he will let himself be found by you” (1 Chron 28:9b). Shortly after that, the Lord appeared to new king Solomon, and told him that no matter how bad things might get, if the people “seek my presence and turn from their evil ways, I will hear them from heaven and pardon their sins” (2 Chron 7:14b). Now, 400 years later, we hear the prophet Isaiah in the First Reading (Is 55:6-9) urging the Jewish people in Exile – who are experiencing how bad it can get – to “seek the Lord.” And the Psalmist today stresses “The Lord is near to all who call upon him” (Ps 145:18).\n\nWhy do the people seek the Lord? In most cases, they are in a bad situation, and they cry out for his mercy and compassion. That is the link. God’s holiness will not tolerate sin; therefore, you always see “conditions” (or better, \"prerequisites\") to a true relationship with Him -- such as the call to “forsake” wicked ways, “turn” from evil ways, and in New Testament times, “repent” – actions which show a humbled heart open to God.\n\nIn our Gospel story (Mt 20:1-16a), we hear the parable of the Vineyard Workers. Notice that the “owner” of the vineyard – God – goes out himself to find the unemployed workers, rather than the other way around. He treats all equally, no matter how late the hour, demonstrating his compassion and mercy to those without dignity. Such is the way of our God with sinners. God is always inviting us to return to his vineyard, and find meaning in a restored relationship with our merciful Creator. He is inviting us to seek Him, and to be assured that He will let himself be found!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM**! We ask the Mother of Mercy to pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death – this humbly acknowledges that we are indeed sinners seeking God’s mercy (CCC #2677). God desires mercy from us also, not sacrifice (CCC #2100). Therefore we must imitate Jesus, and desire to perform works of mercy (CCC #2447) like a true disciple.\n\n---\n\n**It Isn't Fair!**\n\nI suspect that this is the immediate reaction of many people on hearing this parable from today's gospel. We live in a society which is very touchy about justice, about giving individuals their rights. That's probably why we have so many lawsuits. But Isaiah tells us today that our ways are not God's ways. God's ways are far beyond our comprehension, yet we are called to follow God's ways. If God dealt with us in strict justice, we'd be in a bad way, so we should be glad that his ways are different. He forgives where we would demand our pound of flesh. He gives freely, out of love, what we have not earned, a gift, not payment for service. The scriptures show us a God who turns conventional wisdom on its head, sometimes filling us with dismay, sometimes overwhelming us with joy and wonder.\n\n_Blessed are you, O Lord our God, in heaven. You are always near us through your everlasting kindness and generosity. In contrast to our strictness in asserting our rights, it seems to highlight the distance between us. Still you are truly near to all who call upon your name in hope of mercy and forgiveness._",

Born to a noble Roman family in the sixth century, he was first engaged as a public official in a Rome and an Italy that were almost falling apart because of the invasions of Germanic peoples from the north. Then he turned away from governmental work and became a monk. But the current pope did not allow him to remain long in the quiet of his beloved monastery. He sent him as papal ambassador to the emperor at Constantinople. When Gregory returned to Rome, he showed such skill as a churchman that in 590 AD he himself was elected pope, though he tried to avoid the office, fearing its heavy responsibility.</p>\n<p>Because he was so conscientious, his thirteen years as pope proved a godsend for the Church and for Europe. His influence was wide in a hectic era. He was in regular contact with the Frankish rulers of France. He sent St. Augustine of Canterbury to preach Christianity to the Angles and Saxons in Britain. He organized the defense of Italian cities against the Germanic Lombards. He did not hesitate to upbraid the Roman emperor at Constantinople for his acts and oppression. Meanwhile, in an Italy that was impoverished and fatherless, he became its leader, seeing to it that the farmers were treated justly, the Jews were defended, the poor were fed and clothed - even at the cost of selling the silverware of the churches. Nor did he forget his spiritual duties. He was a great preacher, a writer of popular spiritual books, a reformer of Church personnel and a reviser of the liturgy (the Gregorian chant of the Church gets its name from him). At the end of his life Gregory was ill and reduced to skin and bones, but he still kept on. Why? Because he considered himself not the lord of God&apos;s people, but (as he always signed himself) the &quot;Servant of the Servants of God.&quot; That is why he merited the title &quot;the Great.&quot; As today&apos;s gospel reminds us, &quot;If anyone wishes to rank first, he must remain ... the servant of all&quot; (Mark 9:35).</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F.

To &quot;obey&quot; means to &quot;listen&quot; (Lat., obedire), to be open to anything that God might ask you to do to build up the Body of Christ.

Born to a noble Roman family in the sixth century, he was first engaged as a public official in a Rome and an Italy that were almost falling apart because of the invasions of Germanic peoples from the north. Then he turned away from governmental work and became a monk. But the current pope did not allow him to remain long in the quiet of his beloved monastery. He sent him as papal ambassador to the emperor at Constantinople. When Gregory returned to Rome, he showed such skill as a churchman that in 590 AD he himself was elected pope, though he tried to avoid the office, fearing its heavy responsibility.\n\nBecause he was so conscientious, his thirteen years as pope proved a godsend for the Church and for Europe. His influence was wide in a hectic era. He was in regular contact with the Frankish rulers of France. He sent St. Augustine of Canterbury to preach Christianity to the Angles and Saxons in Britain.

The steward, about to be fired by his employer for embezzling, commits one final act of embezzlement to win the favor of his master&apos;s debtors, hoping that they may give him another job. Jesus does not praise the rascal for his dishonesty; but he does give him credit for his cleverness in &quot;winning friends and influencing people.&quot;</p>\n<p>Using our wits is all the more in order when we seek to win a hearing for a good cause by good means. It is only commonsense to speak to people in an idiom they can comprehend. Father Matteo Ricci followed that principle when he went to China in 1582 to bring the gospel to the proud Chinese.</p>\n<p>Ricci was a learned Italian Jesuit. He quickly realized that this &quot;western&quot; Gospel would sound strange to the pagan but highly cultured Chinese leaders whom he sought first to convert. He decided that he and his fellow missionaries could get nowhere with the &quot;Mandarins&quot; or scholars unless they first became &quot;Mandarins&quot; themselves. So they adopted the dress and life-style of this highly revered academic class, and set out to learn their language and literature perfectly. Ricci, in fact, succeeded so well with the language that some of his writings have become Chinese literary classics.</p>\n<p>Once he had gained the confidence of the scholars, Dr. Li (as he called himself) began by discussing with them the admirable rules of morality and social living of their great philosopher, Confucius. But Confucius had not given all the answers - nor raised all the questions. At these open points, Fr. Matteo gently interjected Christian teachings into the discussion. Thus, as Pope John Paul II recently said, &quot;without imposing his views, he ended up by bringing many listeners to the explicit knowledge and authentic worship of God, the Highest Good.&quot;</p>\n<p>It was a painfully slow approach, but the only feasible one. The gospel was not given to the West alone, but to the whole world. It must be, therefore, proclaimed, as at Pentecost, in a manner understandable to every nation. Only thus can mankind hear the message Christ addressed to all his children.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q285: In his first letter to Timothy (Second Reading: 1 Tim 2:1-8), why would St. Paul ask the Christians to pray for the Roman leaders and all others in authority, whose lifestyle and brutality were not exactly models to follow?</strong></p>\n<p>It is probable that this letter was written when Nero was in power. There was an important cultural force at work here in the Roman empire. Since the Christians refused to worship the Roman gods, and would not even burn incense honoring the &quot;divine emperor,&quot; they were considered by the ruling class to be &quot;pagans&quot;! The Christians held private and exclusive gatherings limited to believers in the divinity of Jesus, which made them look suspicious because of their &quot;secret meetings&quot; (even Catechumens were barred from the sacred mysteries, and were dismissed from the assembly).</p>\n<p>St. Paul needed to accomplish three things. First, he needed to alleviate or remove the fears of the political rulers about any potential threats from this new sect whose members called themselves Christians. What better way than to publicly (his letter to Timothy) call for prayers for everyone, especially kings and anyone in authority. Secondly, he needed to teach the Christian community that it was their moral responsibility to obey anyone in a position of valid authority, as long as their orders provided for the good of all, because all such authority ultimately comes from God. Thirdly, he needed to remind the Christians that God wants everyone to be saved, and prayers of believers have great redemptive value and are part of their missionary obligation.</p>\n<p>We need to take this advice to heart in our own society. Rather than pray that our political leaders do what we want them to do, let us ask God to bestow His gifts of wisdom and discernment upon them to enable them to do God&apos;s will.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Authority is considered legitimate only when it seeks the common good and only if it uses morally licit means to attain that good (CCC #1902-3). Since authority belongs to God, the choice of the political regime and the appointment of rulers are left to the free decision of its citizens (CCC #1899, 1901). If rulers enact unjust laws or take measures contrary to the moral order, such arrangements would not be binding in conscience (CCC #1903).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q442: In today&#x2019;s First Reading (Amos 8:4-7), the Prophet Amos seems to be talking to someone other than me; I&#x2019;m not rich or hurting others financially.</strong></p>\n<p>This is one of those days when the Readings seem to give us a false sense of security.

We must use our stewardship over wealth to gain favor from the ultimate owner of everything by feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, etc.\n\n_Lord Jesus, you are our example; may we see what is important in our lives and how to remain faithful to it.  Help us to see the needs of others and be quick to offer them our help.  We look for kindness and understanding in others; may they find your love and care in us._",

One of the themes today is clearly the issue of &quot;changing your mind.&quot; The teaching in the First Reading (Ezek 18:25-28) reminds us that if we turn away from a virtuous life, we shall die (losing eternal life with God). However, if we turn away from evil ways and turn back to God, we shall live. God holds out the offer of salvation, depending on our free will choices.</p>\n<p>The Gospel (Matt 21:28-32) continues this theme. In Jesus&apos; parable about the Two Sons, one refuses to work in the Father&apos;s vineyard, but later changes his mind and does work. The other son said that he would work, but did not do so. The second son was a hypocrite; the first son did the Will of his Father after a change of heart. To this story Jesus draws a lesson: if a sinner changes his ways and repents, he will enter the kingdom of God.</p>\n<p>One of the hardest lessons an American Catholic has to learn today is the humility of obedience to Jesus Christ, and to the Church he established.

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>To such as these</strong></p>\n<p>It was a hard but heroic task for Catholics in Elizabethan England to keep up the practice of their faith. By law, everybody was supposed to belong to the Anglican State Church. Therefore, the only solution for Catholics was to have priests go around in disguise from place to place, offering Mass in private homes at no small risk.</p>\n<p>The English Catholics did receive spiritual rewards for their spiritual daring. Jesuit Father William Weston, one of the courageous English missionaries, tells the story of a fascinating thing that occurred at a Mass celebrated in a secret &quot;Mass-house&quot; by his fellow Jesuit Father Leonard Hyde. Father Weston got the account from Father Hyde himself.</p>\n<p>This Mass was offered around the end of 1685. Among the householders and Catholic friends who attended, with great devotion, there was a small child. The child, evidently a boy, watched wide-eyed all that was going on at the altar and among the participants.</p>\n<p>At the end of Mass, he went up and tugged his mother&apos;s skirt. &quot;Mother, Mother&quot; he said. &quot;What&apos;s the matter, child?&quot; the mother asked him. &quot;Didn&apos;t you see? Didn&apos;t you see?&quot; &quot;See what?&quot; she replied.</p>\n<p>That wonderful little baby! It was so beautiful ... like nothing you have ever seen before. Uncle priest put it in Father&apos;s mouth. Father took it, and it disappeared. Oh, what a pity! He kept repeating &quot;Oh, what a pity! &quot; It was clear that he was deeply moved, and most sad to have the beautiful infant that he saw in the consecrated host disappear.</p>\n<p>When Jesus&apos; disciples tried to keep the little children from clustering about him, they were doubtless trying to spare Him annoyance. But what He saw in the Little ones was mankind at its most innocent. Only if grownups retained or recovered this innocence of eye, could they hope to look on God face-to-face! &quot;It is to such as these,&quot; he says in today&apos;s gospel, &quot;that the kingdom of God belongs.&quot; One day in 1685 He lifted the veil of eternity for a moment to prove His point.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q548: The Pharisees had a reasonable question: if divorce was okay for Moses, why did Jesus object (Mark 10:2-12)?</strong></p>\n<p>I&apos;ve always wondered if today&apos;s priests feel like they are being tested, like Jesus was tested, when folks approach him with a question about divorce. Back in Jesus&apos; day a man could divorce his wife for the slightest excuse. The Jewish Encyclopedia says that the highly respected Rabbi Hillel [who died shortly before Jesus was born] and his school believed that any action of the wife which displeased the man entitled him to give her a bill of divorce. On the other hand, Rabbi Shammai [who died about the same time as Jesus&apos; crucifixion] and his school insisted the reason had to be sexual immorality. But it was only the man who had such rights.

He clearly states this purpose: God intends a permanent marriage bond of love, and an unbreakable bond because it is God who brings two people to the Sacrament. This is the way it was in the beginning in the Genesis story of intimacy, because Eve was created from near the heart of Adam. Moreover, both husband and wife are responsible for maintaining this marriage bond - and both can be guilty of adultery if they disrupt or destroy that bonding process. A marriage bond that is truly sacramental - i.e., there were no impediments at the beginning - cannot be dissolved in the eyes of God.</p>\n<p>Now everyone knows full well the extremely high divorce rate in our sick society, and that includes the Catholic population.

So God created the woman and the two become one flesh. The ancient Jews saw this union of man and woman as a reflection and a symbol of the eternal covenant between God and Israel. Every close friendship requires some self-denial and the close friendship of marriage demands even more.

    "markdown": "**To such as these**\n\nIt was a hard but heroic task for Catholics in Elizabethan England to keep up the practice of their faith. By law, everybody was supposed to belong to the Anglican State Church. Therefore, the only solution for Catholics was to have priests go around in disguise from place to place, offering Mass in private homes at no small risk.\n\nThe English Catholics did receive spiritual rewards for their spiritual daring. Jesuit Father William Weston, one of the courageous English missionaries, tells the story of a fascinating thing that occurred at a Mass celebrated in a secret \"Mass-house\" by his fellow Jesuit Father Leonard Hyde. Father Weston got the account from Father Hyde himself.\n\nThis Mass was offered around the end of 1685. Among the householders and Catholic friends who attended, with great devotion, there was a small child. The child, evidently a boy, watched wide-eyed all that was going on at the altar and among the participants.\n\nAt the end of Mass, he went up and tugged his mother's skirt. \"Mother, Mother\" he said. \"What's the matter, child?\" the mother asked him. \"Didn't you see? Didn't you see?\" \"See what?\" she replied.\n\nThat wonderful little baby! It was so beautiful ... like nothing you have ever seen before. Uncle priest put it in Father's mouth. Father took it, and it disappeared. Oh, what a pity! He kept repeating \"Oh, what a pity! \" It was clear that he was deeply moved, and most sad to have the beautiful infant that he saw in the consecrated host disappear.\n\nWhen Jesus' disciples tried to keep the little children from clustering about him, they were doubtless trying to spare Him annoyance. But what He saw in the Little ones was mankind at its most innocent. Only if grownups retained or recovered this innocence of eye, could they hope to look on God face-to-face! \"It is to such as these,\" he says in today's gospel, \"that the kingdom of God belongs.\" One day in 1685 He lifted the veil of eternity for a moment to prove His point.\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q548: The Pharisees had a reasonable question: if divorce was okay for Moses, why did Jesus object (Mark 10:2-12)?**\n\nI've always wondered if today's priests feel like they are being tested, like Jesus was tested, when folks approach him with a question about divorce. Back in Jesus' day a man could divorce his wife for the slightest excuse. The Jewish Encyclopedia says that the highly respected Rabbi Hillel \\[who died shortly before Jesus was born\\] and his school believed that any action of the wife which displeased the man entitled him to give her a bill of divorce. On the other hand, Rabbi Shammai \\[who died about the same time as Jesus' crucifixion\\] and his school insisted the reason had to be sexual immorality. But it was only the man who had such rights. Most importantly before Moses' ruling, a man could divorce his wife simply with a verbal pronouncement.

This is the way it was in the beginning in the Genesis story of intimacy, because Eve was created from near the heart of Adam.

Do you have a support group of Catholic couples who seek to grow in their marriage spirituality (e.g., \"Teams of Our Lady¨)?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Love seeks to be definitive; it cannot be an arrangement \"until further notice¨ (CCC #1646). Marital intimacy demands total fidelity and requires an unbreakable bond between husband and wife (ibid.). Today, tell your spouse that you love her - and use more than four words!\n\n---\n\n**The Two Shall Become One Flesh**\n\nToday's readings focus on marriage.

In fact, Matthew&apos;s Gospel qualifies the saying by having Jesus say, &quot;If you would be perfect , go sell &#x2026;&quot;</p>\n<p>What are we supposed to get out of this? Most of us are probably like the rich young man. We keep the commandments. We are not guilty of terribly bad actions but we may at times be very complacent.

In fact, Matthew's Gospel qualifies the saying by having Jesus say, \"If you would be perfect , go sell …\"\n\nWhat are we supposed to get out of this? Most of us are probably like the rich young man. We keep the commandments. We are not guilty of terribly bad actions but we may at times be very complacent. We may wonder if that is all we are supposed to do. At times like this we need to remember the words of Wisdom: \"I pleaded and the spirit of wisdom came upon me and in her company all good things.\" Jesus is the embodiment of God's wisdom and he says to us, \"One more thing you must do.\" It may be that he is calling us to greater self giving. It may be something as simple as reconciling with a brother or sister, doing some volunteer work, being more patient with those who annoy us, more generous in sharing of our time and resources. In short, He says to us one more thing you must do; in short he, calls us to greater self giving.\n\n_Lord Jesus, you gave yourself completely on the cross for us. Give us the grace and strength to give more generously of ourselves for others._",

You will remember an example used by Jesus in the gospel five weeks ago (hate your father and mother, wife and children, etc..., Lk 14:26).

But it will produce incredible results when we live that faith and share that faith, because that dead man on the cross rose from the dead, and is our Salvation! Change is always possible, because His dynamic Spirit dwells within us. It is a power so strong that it can be compared to a person telling a tree to be transplanted into the ocean!

Share the treasure (CCC #3)!!</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q600: Faith that can move mountains and uproot mulberry trees? Then why all the evil and suffering around us?</strong></p>\n<p>First let&#x2019;s look at the images that Jesus uses in today&#x2019;s gospel. The mulberry tree grows to an average height of about forty feet, and it has a root system goes about six feet deep and spreads out to quite a degree. On the other hand, the mustard tree grows to about ten feet in height; but every seed is very tiny, about the size of just one of those little round sprinkles on your kid&#x2019;s birthday cake &#x2013; or even smaller. In Jesus&#x2019; time the Jews believed it was the smallest seed in existence.</p>\n<p>Jesus uses hyperbole (exaggeration in the usual Jewish fashion) on many occasions in his stories and parables, to make a specific point. Today&#x2019;s gospel (Luke 17:5-10) is no exception. Jesus is saying that the quantity (or size) of your faith is not an issue. It is the quality that counts. Faith works; no matter how timid you might be, if you step out in faith and make your tiny gifts available to the Lord, it will result in a multiplication by the Lord beyond your wildest imagination! You may not even be around to see the results.</p>\n<p>We face a very challenging society &#x2013; and a very sick one at that. The odds against us seem to be overwhelming. &#x201C;What can little old me do? I&#x2019;m just one voice!&#x201D; Jesus says, don&#x2019;t worry. Just trust in Him! Do you really believe that he multiplied the loaves and fishes on more than one occasion? Then why do you doubt what he can do with your simple act of stepping out in faith, speaking the truth, and leaving the rest up to Him? It takes great humility, and a realization that all we have is gift from God, to recognize that just plain old simple faith is all we need to bring the Holy Spirit to bear on a circumstance with which we are confronted. Be faithful in your total, trusting dependence on the Lord!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> We walk by faith, not by sight, and our faith can be put to the test. When tempted to doubt because of the evil and suffering around us, we look to the witnesses of faith to see their example of patient perseverance under overwhelming obstacles (CCC 164-165). Trust in the Lord! Do you think that mulberry tree grew to forty feet overnight? Patience!</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>We Are Worthless Slaves</strong></p>\n<p>I thought the gospel was good news, but the last line of today&apos;s gospel sounds more like bad news -- &quot;worthless slaves&quot;?&#xA0; Me?&#xA0; Yes, that&apos;s what the Lord tells us today. In Jesus&apos; time slavery was taken for granted. The slave was not an employee who earned his living, but the property of his master. So he earns nothing when he does his job; the master owes him nothing for his labor. So it is with us. God made us and we are his. When we live out our covenant obligation to God we have put God under no obligation to us. Jesus goes even further in Mark&apos;s Gospel 10: 44.&#xA0; &quot;Whoever wishes to be first among you will be the slave of all.&quot;</p>\n<p>But there is Good News in this scripture passage. Slaves in the ancient world were part of the master&apos;s household. They belonged to the household in ways no hired hand could. They were taken care of not because they had done this or that, but because they belonged to the household, the family. So too with us. In living the life of faith we belong to God&apos;s household, God&apos;s family. We belong! We are not getting exactly what we have earned as employees. The Good News is that we are saved by our faithful response to God&apos;s call.</p>\n<p><em>Lord God, help us to remember who and what we are, members of your family, members of the Body of Christ.

The second surprise (at least for Jesus&#x2019; audience) was to find out that the only grateful person was a hated Samaritan.</p>\n<p>Now, I believe that there is a deeper lesson being taught here; that lesson is much more than a simple &#x201C;reminder&#x201D; to be grateful for blessings received. Look farther down the road, as the ten lepers headed towards Jerusalem to &#x201C;show themselves to the priests.&#x201D; Do you really think that a hated Samaritan would even be allowed into the Temple without opposition?

But I think it very possible that the &#x201C;deeper&#x201D; meaning is this: only a Samaritan &#x2013; like the one who had earlier in Luke&#x2019;s gospel demonstrated that he truly was the only &#x201C;good neighbor&#x201D; to someone in need, the injured traveler &#x2013; only a Samaritan knew where the REAL presence of God could be found. Not in the Temple, where the other nine went to give ritual thanksgiving in obedience to the &#x201C;law.&#x201D; Rather, he went to Jesus, the source of his salvation, to give heartfelt thanksgiving in obedience to the gratefulness in his &#x201C;heart.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The most important &#x201C;memory&#x201D; event of a Jewish person&#x2019;s life was to recall that transforming day of &#x201C;salvation&#x201D; at the Sea of Reeds centuries earlier. This was celebrated by them in a ritual festival called Passover. But now, when the salvation of &#x201C;wholeness&#x201D; is once again demonstrated to ten lepers in a real experience of the same saving power of God, only the Samaritan remembers and returns to the source of healing, Jesus. Lesson: healing is not dependent on the size of your faith; it is only God&#x2019;s Gift that causes transforming events.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Have you ever considered that it is a duty and an expression of gratitude to visit the Blessed Sacrament, to thank Jesus for his gifts to you (CCC #1418)? Learn from the Blessed Virgin Mary, who confesses with gratitude that God has done great things for her (CCC #2097).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Give Thanks to the Lord Invoke His Name</strong><br>\n\tThe reading from the second Book of Kings is strange. Why does Naaman haul away a pile of dirt?&#xA0; What is so special about Palestinian dirt?&#xA0; We have to remember that Naaman was a Gentile, a pagan and in those days people connected a god and his power with a particular locality. You were closest to the god and his power when you were in his territory. Naaman had experienced the power and the mercy of the God of Israel and had come to believe that this was the only God, the universal God. He wanted to give thanks and praise for his cure by offering sacrifice on an altar built on soil from Israel. This would be a sign of unity with the land of Israel where God was present in a special way.</p>\n<p>St. Luke tells us of another foreigner cured of leprosy. Jesus tells the ten lepers to go to the priests and fulfill the requirements of the Mosaic Law. For the leper this presented a problem. He was a Samaritan --Which temple should he go to? The Jewish temple in Jerusalem or the Samaritan temple on Mt. Gerizim? Like Naaman he has a concern for the proper place to find the presence of the Lord. But then he realizes that neither temple is the place to find God&apos;s presence. The place to find the presence of God is the person of Jesus Christ. Here, wherever Jesus is, that is the place to encounter the healing presence of God and it is there he should give thanks and praise to God. These stories remind us that God&apos;s mercy and gifts are not limited by the barriers which we humans set up.</p>\n<p><em>Lord, may we follow the example of Naaman and the Samaritan. Remind us of the many gifts we have received from your hand. May they inspire us to give you thanks and praise for all you have done for us. Forgive us for the times we fail to care and love those around us.</em></p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

Learn from the Blessed Virgin Mary, who confesses with gratitude that God has done great things for her (CCC #2097).\n\n---\n\n**Give Thanks to the Lord Invoke His Name**  \nThe reading from the second Book of Kings is strange. Why does Naaman haul away a pile of dirt?  What is so special about Palestinian dirt?  We have to remember that Naaman was a Gentile, a pagan and in those days people connected a god and his power with a particular locality. You were closest to the god and his power when you were in his territory. Naaman had experienced the power and the mercy of the God of Israel and had come to believe that this was the only God, the universal God. He wanted to give thanks and praise for his cure by offering sacrifice on an altar built on soil from Israel. This would be a sign of unity with the land of Israel where God was present in a special way.\n\nSt. Luke tells us of another foreigner cured of leprosy. Jesus tells the ten lepers to go to the priests and fulfill the requirements of the Mosaic Law. For the leper this presented a problem. He was a Samaritan --Which temple should he go to? The Jewish temple in Jerusalem or the Samaritan temple on Mt. Gerizim? Like Naaman he has a concern for the proper place to find the presence of the Lord. But then he realizes that neither temple is the place to find God's presence. The place to find the presence of God is the person of Jesus Christ. Here, wherever Jesus is, that is the place to encounter the healing presence of God and it is there he should give thanks and praise to God. These stories remind us that God's mercy and gifts are not limited by the barriers which we humans set up.\n\n_Lord, may we follow the example of Naaman and the Samaritan. Remind us of the many gifts we have received from your hand. May they inspire us to give you thanks and praise for all you have done for us. Forgive us for the times we fail to care and love those around us._",

Blood was taken from donors to be stored for later transfer into the bodies of those who had themselves suffered a major loss of blood. Rarely, since then, have we heard of the givers of blood charging for that service. Bloodgiving has rather struck people as an act of charity and compassion towards those whose life is endangered. Particularly during World War II those who were donating to the American Red Cross blood banks would vie with each other to become &quot;gallonaires&quot; - donors (at medically prescribed intervals) of a gallon of their life-blood.</p>\n<p>Blood-banks were not restricted to the United States. The practice of donating one&apos;s blood spread everywhere. To the Christians of the world the gift of blood was not only something humane, but something Christ-like. Pope Pius XII pointed this out in the fall of 1948. During and after World War II, many Italians had given generously of their blood to save the lives of the thousands who had been wounded or otherwise stricken in the Italian Campaign. In Autumn 1948 a group of these Italian blood donors had a special audience with the Holy Father. Praising their true Christian generosity, he told them &quot;Christ, the supreme and divine donor of His Blood, is your example in a particular way.&quot;</p>\n<p>In today&apos;s first reading, the prophet Isaiah foresees that the death of Christ will be the cause of life for mankind. &quot;If he gives his life as an offering for sin, he shall see his descendants in a long line...&quot; (53:10). A moment before, Isaiah had said &quot;By his stripes we were healed&quot; (53:5). Know then, whenever you give blood to your fellow-man that you, like Jesus, are giving of your very self so that others may live.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q394: James and John come across in today&apos;s Gospel (Mk 10:35-45) as very selfish people. They are only concerned about their own status. How come Jesus picked them as apostles?</strong></p>\n<p>We humanoids really are a &quot;controlling&quot; bunch, aren&apos;t we? What do you think would happen if God gave in to our every whim and wish? &quot;Hey God, if you let me win the lottery, then I&apos;ll give 90% of the winnings to the poor&#x2026;&quot; Think about it: are the circumstances of the poor really on my mind, or is it that other 10% that I am thinking about? If the poor really mattered to us, we wouldn&apos;t worry about the lottery; we would be doing everything within our means to help them right now, not waiting for the lottery results.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s all about attitude. James and John (and their mamma) misunderstood what the &quot;kingdom&quot; was all about. They were still thinking that Jesus would be establishing his rule on this earth, like King David centuries before. So since they were very close to Jesus, it seemed only &quot;natural&quot; to them that he would pick his friends to be his chief officers. But even with that misunderstanding, their attitude was clearly &quot;selfish&quot; and controlling - they wanted to get in their bid for the choice positions before the other apostles did.</p>\n<p>It would take more time, but eventually all of the apostles would understand. The way of life in the kingdom of God, and the attitude that is required, is one that reflects only concern for God and concern for others. This is a life of Servanthood. We are not called to be controlling, but to be servants. There is a gigantic difference in the attitudes connected with each of those two choices. So, as a disciple of Jesus, how would you describe your attitude towards the immigrant, the poor, the diseased, and the fallen away? Is your love for each and your unconditional willingness to serve them still fully intact?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Jesus is our model of selflessness; he submitted himself entirely to his Father&apos;s will out of love for us (CCC #536). We have this possibility of becoming &quot;partners&quot; will Jesus, to be a servant just like him - &quot;there is no other ladder by which we may get to heaven&quot; (CCC #618).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q550: The Prophet Isaiah says that &#x201C;the Lord was pleased to crush him in infirmity&#x201D; (Isaiah 53:10). How can this be? How can crushing someone possibly please God?</strong></p>\n<p>God our Father is neither sadistic nor cruel. There is not even a hint of those negative attributes, if the Isaian passage is properly understood. We are in the area of divine mystery here, so let&#x2019;s explore this mystery of our faith as best we can.</p>\n<p>First of all, we need to remember the Jewish understanding of God&#x2019;s will back in Jesus&#x2019; time. Life was simple. God directly caused everything to happen, both life and death, pleasure and pain. The Jewish understanding of covenant was also simple: God will either reward or punish you, based on your behavior. If you sinned, you would incur the wrath of God, because he is a God of justice. If you repented and changed your ways, you would be restored to right relationship with God, because he is a God of mercy.</p>\n<p>But there came the promised New Covenant. Jesus offered his life as a sacrifice for the sins of all humanity. His agony and death were the cup that he asked James and John to share (Mark 10:35-45). He was indeed crushed for our sins, for all the sins of humanity that were unrepented and unforgiven. God did not cause the pain and death of Jesus; rather, he permitted the free will choices of ungodly people to happen during Holy Week, knowing that the end result would bring him great glory. The offer of Jesus&#x2019; life was accepted by the Father, as an atonement for the sins of all humanity. Jesus redeemed us all, and won the victory over sin and death. This salvific action of Jesus is what brought the Father great joy and pleasure, because it opened up a way, once and for all, for each one of us to have a restored relationship with Him! The gates of heaven were open once again!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>By his obedience unto death, Jesus accomplished the substitution of the suffering Servant &#x2013; atoning for our faults and making satisfaction for our sins to the Father (CCC #615).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Can You Drink of My Cup</strong></p>\n<p>For several Sundays we have been hearing Jesus making some tough demands of his disciples. But they never seem to get it. Today we hear them again asking for the best places and Jesus once more repeats his demanding message to them and to us. We must try to understand the demands made on us in following Jesus. He calls us to be leaders by serving the needs of others, and he is the perfect example of it. We are called to drink of his cup, which means accepting the reality of suffering in doing God&apos;s work. We don&apos;t have to like it. We may not always succeed in overcoming our reluctance. But even if we fail, Jesus will welcome us back. He knows how hard it is because he experienced the same fear and reluctance in Gethsemane.</p>\n<p><em>Lord Jesus, you give comfort to the sorrowful and strength to those in pain; fill our hearts with your love so that our day may be spent in giving to all around us. Help us say no to our self interests and to follow Your example in the service of others no matter what the cost.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

    "markdown": "**He Gives His Life**\n\nOne of the most remarkable medical developments in the 1930's and 1940's was the blood-bank. Blood was taken from donors to be stored for later transfer into the bodies of those who had themselves suffered a major loss of blood. Rarely, since then, have we heard of the givers of blood charging for that service. Bloodgiving has rather struck people as an act of charity and compassion towards those whose life is endangered. Particularly during World War II those who were donating to the American Red Cross blood banks would vie with each other to become \"gallonaires\" - donors (at medically prescribed intervals) of a gallon of their life-blood.\n\nBlood-banks were not restricted to the United States. The practice of donating one's blood spread everywhere. To the Christians of the world the gift of blood was not only something humane, but something Christ-like. Pope Pius XII pointed this out in the fall of 1948. During and after World War II, many Italians had given generously of their blood to save the lives of the thousands who had been wounded or otherwise stricken in the Italian Campaign. In Autumn 1948 a group of these Italian blood donors had a special audience with the Holy Father. Praising their true Christian generosity, he told them \"Christ, the supreme and divine donor of His Blood, is your example in a particular way.\"\n\nIn today's first reading, the prophet Isaiah foresees that the death of Christ will be the cause of life for mankind. \"If he gives his life as an offering for sin, he shall see his descendants in a long line...\" (53:10). A moment before, Isaiah had said \"By his stripes we were healed\" (53:5). Know then, whenever you give blood to your fellow-man that you, like Jesus, are giving of your very self so that others may live.\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q394: James and John come across in today's Gospel (Mk 10:35-45) as very selfish people. They are only concerned about their own status. How come Jesus picked them as apostles?**\n\nWe humanoids really are a \"controlling\" bunch, aren't we? What do you think would happen if God gave in to our every whim and wish? \"Hey God, if you let me win the lottery, then I'll give 90% of the winnings to the poor…\" Think about it: are the circumstances of the poor really on my mind, or is it that other 10% that I am thinking about? If the poor really mattered to us, we wouldn't worry about the lottery; we would be doing everything within our means to help them right now, not waiting for the lottery results.\n\nIt's all about attitude. James and John (and their mamma) misunderstood what the \"kingdom\" was all about. They were still thinking that Jesus would be establishing his rule on this earth, like King David centuries before. So since they were very close to Jesus, it seemed only \"natural\" to them that he would pick his friends to be his chief officers. But even with that misunderstanding, their attitude was clearly \"selfish\" and controlling - they wanted to get in their bid for the choice positions before the other apostles did.\n\nIt would take more time, but eventually all of the apostles would understand. The way of life in the kingdom of God, and the attitude that is required, is one that reflects only concern for God and concern for others. This is a life of Servanthood. We are not called to be controlling, but to be servants. There is a gigantic difference in the attitudes connected with each of those two choices. So, as a disciple of Jesus, how would you describe your attitude towards the immigrant, the poor, the diseased, and the fallen away? Is your love for each and your unconditional willingness to serve them still fully intact?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Jesus is our model of selflessness; he submitted himself entirely to his Father's will out of love for us (CCC #536). We have this possibility of becoming \"partners\" will Jesus, to be a servant just like him - \"there is no other ladder by which we may get to heaven\" (CCC #618).\n\n---\n\n**Q550: The Prophet Isaiah says that “the Lord was pleased to crush him in infirmity” (Isaiah 53:10). How can this be? How can crushing someone possibly please God?**\n\nGod our Father is neither sadistic nor cruel. There is not even a hint of those negative attributes, if the Isaian passage is properly understood. We are in the area of divine mystery here, so let’s explore this mystery of our faith as best we can.\n\nFirst of all, we need to remember the Jewish understanding of God’s will back in Jesus’ time. Life was simple. God directly caused everything to happen, both life and death, pleasure and pain. The Jewish understanding of covenant was also simple: God will either reward or punish you, based on your behavior. If you sinned, you would incur the wrath of God, because he is a God of justice. If you repented and changed your ways, you would be restored to right relationship with God, because he is a God of mercy.\n\nBut there came the promised New Covenant. Jesus offered his life as a sacrifice for the sins of all humanity. His agony and death were the cup that he asked James and John to share (Mark 10:35-45). He was indeed crushed for our sins, for all the sins of humanity that were unrepented and unforgiven. God did not cause the pain and death of Jesus; rather, he permitted the free will choices of ungodly people to happen during Holy Week, knowing that the end result would bring him great glory. The offer of Jesus’ life was accepted by the Father, as an atonement for the sins of all humanity. Jesus redeemed us all, and won the victory over sin and death. This salvific action of Jesus is what brought the Father great joy and pleasure, because it opened up a way, once and for all, for each one of us to have a restored relationship with Him! The gates of heaven were open once again!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** By his obedience unto death, Jesus accomplished the substitution of the suffering Servant – atoning for our faults and making satisfaction for our sins to the Father (CCC #615).\n\n---\n\n**Can You Drink of My Cup**\n\nFor several Sundays we have been hearing Jesus making some tough demands of his disciples. But they never seem to get it. Today we hear them again asking for the best places and Jesus once more repeats his demanding message to them and to us. We must try to understand the demands made on us in following Jesus. He calls us to be leaders by serving the needs of others, and he is the perfect example of it. We are called to drink of his cup, which means accepting the reality of suffering in doing God's work. We don't have to like it. We may not always succeed in overcoming our reluctance. But even if we fail, Jesus will welcome us back. He knows how hard it is because he experienced the same fear and reluctance in Gethsemane.\n\n_Lord Jesus, you give comfort to the sorrowful and strength to those in pain; fill our hearts with your love so that our day may be spent in giving to all around us. Help us say no to our self interests and to follow Your example in the service of others no matter what the cost._",

One of their severest battles was with Amalek. As the conflict continued in the valley, Moses stood on the heights, his hands lifted in prayer. When his hands drooped through weariness, the Amalekites seemed to be winning. But when his hands were held high, the Israelites had the advantage. So Aaron and Hur stood beside him and held up his arms till dusk. The Israelites won.

Prince Alexander Hohenlohe, a devout German nobleman, became a priest in 1794, and later on an auxiliary bishop. On February 1, 1821, Father Hohenlohe was suddenly cured of an ailment through the prayers of a holy peasant. On June 21, his prayers, joined with those of the same peasant, cured a paralyzed princess. After that, with permission of the pope, the priest began to gather an international list of &quot;co-prayers&quot;. He would specify the time he was going to offer Mass for a certain intention, so at that time the hearts of many would be raised in prayer in several nations. A large number of cures followed. Several were in the United States. The most noted here was that of Mrs. Ann Mattingly of Washington, the sister of Thomas Carbery, a bank president and mayor of Washington. She had been bedridden with an incurable tumor for months. Washington priests asked Hohenlohe to put her on his list. Ann grew worse during the novena, but after receiving communion on March 10, 1824, she was completely cured from her bed. &quot;Lord Jesus!&quot; she cried, &quot;what have I done to deserve so good a favor?&quot;</p>\n<p>One person with deep faith, Jesus tells us, can move mountains. But it is quite clear that when a whole crowd of people &quot;lobby&quot; for the same intention, God is still more willing to listen and answer.</p>\n<p>-Fr. Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q289: Is today&apos;s parable about the widow and unjust judge (Luke 18:1-8) teaching us that &quot;hassling&quot; God is the only way to get our prayers answered?</strong></p>\n<p>The theme of &quot;persistent prayer&quot; needs to be understood not as &quot;hassling&quot; God, but rather as a consequence of a strong faith that believes God hears prayers and will indeed answer them in his own time. So the underlying theme is really the need to have faith in all circumstances, good or adverse.</p>\n<p>&quot;Difficult&quot; parables can many times have abundant light shed upon them by comparing the gospel reading with the First Reading. In today&apos;s case the comparison would be to Exodus 17:8-13. Victory came to the Hebrew warriors against the Amalekites only as long as they could see Moses holding up his arms and staff -- &quot;signs&quot; that God was present and supportive. If Moses became tired and his arms dropped, the Hebrews would start losing ground, because their faith concerning God&apos;s presence began to waver.</p>\n<p>In the gospel story, the poor widow found herself in adverse circumstances. She had been treated unjustly, and now she is also being denied justice from a judicial authority. But she has faith that Yahweh will provide justice, because she knows of his love and care for widows and others who are also powerless. So she continues her efforts based upon that faith. And her unwavering faith leads to a satisfactory ending for her (18:5). Jesus has already told the disciples to have faith and persevere (18:1), and he concludes his story with the question, &quot;will the Son of Man find faith on earth when he comes (18:8)? Will he?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> One measure of the depth of our faith is our constancy in prayer, because prayer is a battle of faith and the triumph of perseverance (CCC #2573). Do we pray in all circumstances -- not just the bad, but also the good (CCC #2609-10)? Humility is the foundation of prayer, as we realize our total dependence on God for everything we need (CCC #2559).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q602: Why doesn&#x2019;t God answer prayers and correct all the evils in this world?</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to cultural morality and social justice issues, it is easy to fall into the trap of treating God like a robot. We just pray for something, and then tend to wait for God to act. Well, that doesn&#x2019;t seem to be the way that God wants the process of intervention to work. Our readings today give us two lively examples of God&#x2019;s way. In the First Reading (Ex 17:8-13) evil in the form of King Amalek needs to be confronted directly by human beings, and God intervenes by acting in and through these humans. The story clearly shows that victory over evil occurred only with the participation of humans in the process. In the Gospel (Luke 18:1-8) God again intervenes by acting in and through the widow who confronts the injustice she is facing. Her perseverance and willingness to object to injustice gained the victory.</p>\n<p>That is exactly the point. God certainly wants us to petition him for all of our needs; we need to keep our dependency relationship in mind and not take God for granted. However, he wants us to participate fully with him in that process of righting the moral wrongdoings of our society. That is what discipleship is all about. We make ourselves available to God, to be his instruments in changing the immoral and unjust climate that surrounds us. On World Mission Sunday, we are reminded of our obligation as disciples to spread the Good News of the Gospel. That always includes the need to confront injustices wherever we find them, and being willing to become God&#x2019;s instruments to effect change.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Social justice can be obtained only in respecting the transcendent dignity of all human beings, from conception to death; this is a right that comes prior to the rights of society (CCC 1929-31). The Church has retained the symbol of prayer as a battle of faith and as the triumph of perseverance (CCC 2573).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Be Persistent in Good Times and Bad</strong></p>\n<p>&quot;Persistence&quot; --That&apos;s the message of today&apos;s liturgy. The Israel depended on God to stand with her against those who would destroy her.&#xA0; Moses holds high the &quot;Staff of God,&quot; the symbol of their interior prayer and trusting faith in God&apos;s protection. In the epistle St. Paul encourages Timothy to persevere in faith, in studying the scriptures, and in preaching the gospel. Finally Jesus tells the disciples a parable about their need to pray always and never lose heart. What are they supposed to pray for so persistently? We should pray for all our needs, great and small, and for those we love and for those in need. But St. Luke seems to have something more specific in mind.The widow secures justice from the corrupt judge by her persistent appeals.&#xA0; The words &quot;justice&quot; and &quot;judge&quot; keep appearing.</p>\n<p>This parable is calling us to persistent prayer for a kingdom of justice, for the completion of God&apos;s work in Jesus. The final coming of the kingdom of justice will be with the second coming of Jesus in glory to complete the work he had begun in his public ministry. This is the theme of these final weeks of the liturgical year. So we are reminded today that a corrupt judge will grant justice because the widow persists, how much more will; God grant justice to those who persevere in prayer.</p>\n<p><em>Lord, we are so taken up with our own concerns that we often forget the broader concerns of your kingdom.

Next we see Pontius Pilate, a procurator (officer of the Empire and agent of the Emperor). Then come three tetrarchs, each one a governor of a section of the Province. Having named the big-wigs of temporal power, he now turns to the big-wigs of Jewish religious authority, naming both Annas and Caiaphas who hold the two highest positions in Judaism. The power structure is complete.</p>\n<p>But what do we see God doing? This is where Luke&apos;s genius comes into play. Luke sees clearly that it is not the emperors, governors, and high priests that God wants to speak through. Instead of using the power structure or political structure, he speaks His word to a simple, God-fearing, locust-eating desert man, who dressed in clothes made of camel&apos;s hair (Mt 3:4)! This message was the most exciting message ever heard up to that point in time: the Messiah was coming, and all humankind would see the salvation of God!</p>\n<p>God always chooses the lowly, the humble, those who are trying to do His will.

Having named the big-wigs of temporal power, he now turns to the big-wigs of Jewish religious authority, naming both Annas and Caiaphas who hold the two highest positions in Judaism. The power structure is complete.\n\nBut what do we see God doing? This is where Luke's genius comes into play. Luke sees clearly that it is not the emperors, governors, and high priests that God wants to speak through. Instead of using the power structure or political structure, he speaks His word to a simple, God-fearing, locust-eating desert man, who dressed in clothes made of camel's hair (Mt 3:4)! This message was the most exciting message ever heard up to that point in time: the Messiah was coming, and all humankind would see the salvation of God!\n\nGod always chooses the lowly, the humble, those who are trying to do His will. Nowhere is this more evident than in the selection of John the Baptist to be the bearer of God's word! This gives us great hope. It is not the exercise of power nor the holding of possessions that matters. The only thing that matters is the condition of our heart, which reflects our relationship with God.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Two significant Advent values are Hope and Humility - and it can't be coincidental that both are listed consecutively in the Glossary to the Catechism (p.882). Hope enables us to desire and expect eternal life with God (CCC #1817), as we humbly and trustingly await the return of the Lord Jesus in glory (CCC #840).\n\n---\n\n**Prepare the Way of the Lord**\n\nThe Prophet Baruch speaks of God tearing down the mountains and filling in the pot holes, making a smooth road over which he will bring his crushed and scattered people back to a renewed and glorified Jerusalem. John the Baptist calls us to clear a straight path for the coming of the Lord with God's salvation. We too are called to these tasks of preparing for the coming of the Lord. How can we help make the road easier for the coming. We can help to prepare the way of the Lord by our common prayer and by giving an example of what faith in Jesus can mean.\n\n_Lord help us to go before you to clear your way by tearing down the mountains of pride and self - satisfaction that stand in the way of your coming. Help us to bridge the chasms created by our weakness and lack of understanding._",

They fanned out from the trail and kept looking for three days. Finally, thanks to a hunch of one of the hunters in the posse they discovered the little wanderer. Kate was hungry and a little scratched-up but otherwise sound in body and mind. In fact, her only real fear was facing her mother. She had lost her socks and was afraid of a big scolding.</p>\n<p>Now somebody might ask (say a robot): Why should 200 people take three days off and go traipsing through the woods in search of one small child only ten years of age?</p>\n<p>Anybody with a heart could answer. All the living things of earth that God has created are precious. Most precious among his creatures is the human being, no matter how small. He made us lovingly in his own image and likeness. He made sparrows, too; but we are worth more to him and to our fellowmen than many sparrows.</p>\n<p>&quot;...

We &#x201C;aficionados&#x201D; of crab meat &#x2013; both as cooks and as consumers &#x2013; are aware that growing crabs &#x201C;molt&#x201D; every so often as they grow. This means that they shed their outer shell, which does not grow, to make room for a new shell more conducive to housing their growing body. And they need lots of &#x201C;moisture&#x201D; to avoid death and to make the process less painful. This &#x201C;self-shedding of the old&#x201D; is doing &#x201C;radical violence&#x201D; to what we call the crab&#x2019;s body.

Continued spiritual growth is an absolutely essential part of our preparation for eternity; it is our way of &#x201C;preparing the way of the Lord&#x201D; who will come again at a time unknown to us, without warning.

Mark&apos;s Gospel begins with John the Baptist answering the call and fulfilling the role of Elijah. How does he do it? By calling the people to repent. Sounds simple: just be sorry for your sins! But there is more to it than that. The kind of repentance John calls for involves a complete change of direction, from self absorption to self-surrender, from self-indulgence to self-sacrifice, from selfishness to love.

In this spiritual banquet, He performed a sacrificial action inseparable from His self-sacrifice the following day on the cross. Death on the cross was once and for all; but the sacrificial banquet was something that could be easily repeated. So He told the apostles to continue ever afterward to represent his saving death by repeating this sacred action.</p>\n<p>Jesus gave us the sacrificial banquet, but He did not attach any name to it. Consequently, at different times and in different places different names have been used of it. We of the Latin-rite are most accustomed to the term &quot;the Mass,&quot; although this word derives from a very incidental phrase in our rite: &quot;Ite, missa est.&quot; (&quot;Go, it is the dismissal&quot;). Since Vatican II there is a trend to return to a more ancient phrase, &quot;the Eucharist.&quot; This Greek word means &quot;a giving of thanks.&quot;</p>\n<p>The very first term applied to the Mass was simply &quot;the breaking of bread.&quot; That is the phrase used in today&apos;s second reading. Speaking about the earliest days of the Church, it says &quot;The brothers devoted themselves to the apostles&apos; instruction and the communal life, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.&quot;</p>\n<p>Later on, this supper rite became more formalized, and it was prefaced by what we call the fore-part of the Mass - the scriptural readings and various prayers. The ceremonies also developed differently in different sections of the ancient Christian world, east and west. But, if you probe beneath the surface, you will find that the basic ritual is the same.</p>\n<p>Here is the Mass as it was celebrated in the year 150 AD. St. Justin, martyr, wrote the description. Does it sound at all familiar?</p>\n<p>&quot;On the day named after the sun (Sunday), all who live in city or countryside assemble. The memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read for as long as time allows. When the lector has finished, the president addresses us and exhorts us to imitate the splendid things we have heard. Then we all stand and pray.</p>\n<p>&quot;When we have finished praying, bread, wine and water are brought us. The president prays and gives thanks according to his ability, and the people give their assent with an `Amen&apos;. Next, the gifts over which the thanksgiving has been spoken are distributed and everyone shares in them... &quot;</p>\n<p>Indeed it does sound familiar. Jesus told us to &quot;do this in memory of me,&quot; and we are still obeying His precious command.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q313: Did Thomas get a bum rap, being called &#x201C;Doubting Thomas&#x201D; for his unbelief (Jn 20:19-31)? Isn&#x2019;t &#x2018;doubt&#x2019; an absolutely normal condition of uncertainty for humans, caused by lack of evidence?</strong></p>\n<p>Doubt and a &#x2018;desire for certainty&#x2019; take many forms in our society. &#x201C;Show me the money,&#x201D; an unbelieving football professional tells his agent in scenes from the 1996 movie &#x201C;Jerry McGuire.&#x201D; &#x201C;Show me the ring,&#x201D; a long-suffering woman says impatiently to her beau, demanding concrete proof of his commitment. Missouri&#x2019;s state nickname is the &#x201C;Show Me&#x201D; state, coined in 1899 by Congressman Willard Vandiver who could not be convinced by &#x201C;frothy eloquence&#x201D; alone, and wanted hard evidence.</p>\n<p>The apostle Thomas, too, wanted &#x201C;proof&#x201D; that would convince his senses that Jesus is indeed risen from the dead; &#x201C;show me&#x201D; would be an apt description of his stance. And there is the key word, &#x201C;senses&#x201D; -- Thomas wanted his eyes to reveal the truth to him, and his touch to confirm that truth. He was relying on the sensory world and his physical abilities to reach the truth.</p>\n<p>However, through the skepticism of the apostle Thomas, Jesus passed on his message to all of us: it is not our physical eyes that count, but our spiritual eyes. We are being asked to believe based on the eyewitness testimony of others. This is called &#x201C;faith,&#x201D; believing in something we cannot see with our normal senses. And our openness to the action of the Holy Spirit is called blessed by Jesus in the gospel -- &#x201C;Blessed are they who have not seen, and have believed.&#x201D; We can thank the Holy Spirit that this story about St. Thomas was preserved, so that we do not persist in unbelief.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>When we believe without &#x201C;seeing,&#x201D; we encounter the risen Lord and can say with Thomas, &#x201C;My Lord and my God&#x201D; (CCC #448). All of the disciples were doubtful, not just Thomas, and their faith was born under the action of divine grace as they experienced the reality of the risen Jesus (CCC #644). It is through believing that we have &#x201C;life&#x201D; in his name (CCC #514).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q469: It seems that Jesus Christ works in special ways in groups, after his Resurrection.</strong></p>\n<p>The pervading thought in today&#x2019;s two readings almost overwhelms us: we find Jesus in a special way in community! The First Reading (Acts 2:42-47) shows what can happen if we share our faith and make the spiritual journey together. We find people praying together regularly, celebrating Eucharist together regularly, and sharing their possessions with those in need. Is it any wonder that the loving witness of their lives should catch the attention of their neighbors, and lead to more conversions? Our Lord makes his presence known in such communities, including &#x201C;signs and wonders&#x201D; he works through them as a result of their faith.</p>\n<p>We find the same communal setting occurring in the gospel (John 20:19-31). The difference seems to be that this time they are doing more than sharing bread and prayers; they are sharing fear! They are behind locked doors, afraid for their lives. Still, it is into this communal gathering that the Lord chooses to appear, providing the things that take away fear: his peace and the Holy Spirit!</p>\n<p>One more gift is given to the community of apostles: the power to forgive sins! It is not only fear of physical harm that is removed by the peace of Jesus; now he removes fear of the afterlife. An avenue has been opened to continue the saving action of Jesus, through the Sacrament of Forgiveness!</p>\n<p>The Easter Season is a special time to celebrate with one&#x2019;s entire being this greatest of events in the history of the world, the Resurrection! Not only that, today on Divine Mercy Sunday we celebrate the love, forgiveness and mercy of Jesus &#x2013; tender gifts that he longs to give to us freely, if we will only accept them!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Our Lord told Saint Faustina, &#x201C;When you approach the confessional, know this, that I Myself am waiting there for you. I am only hidden by the priest, but I Myself act in your soul. Here the misery of the soul meets the God of mercy. Tell souls that from this fount of mercy souls draw graces solely with the vessel of trust. If their trust is great, there is no limit to My generosity.&quot; Pope John Paul II designated today &#x2018;Divine Mercy Sunday&#x2019; on the occasion of Faustina&#x2019;s canonization on April 30, 2000. Through the Sacrament of Confession, we are reconciled with God and the Body of Christ (CCC #1444).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Lord, I do Believe, Help my Unbelief.</strong></p>\n<p>These words in another Gospel passage were a petitioner&apos;s response when asked if he believed Jesus could cure his child. They could have been a fitting response for doubting Thomas and could be appropriate for us when we find following Christ difficult. The other apostles saw Jesus on Easter morn and they believed But their belief was not confined to words. They went out and shared their joy with others, doing good for the sick and possessed. When Thomas saw the Lord he responded with the most explicit confession of faith in John&apos;s Gospel: &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot; By Baptism we believe that we have been joined to Jesus in his death and resurrection. We are called to follow the example of the apostles even when that is hard to do.</p>\n<p><em>Lord, I do believe.

And there is the key word, “senses” -- Thomas wanted his eyes to reveal the truth to him, and his touch to confirm that truth. He was relying on the sensory world and his physical abilities to reach the truth.\n\nHowever, through the skepticism of the apostle Thomas, Jesus passed on his message to all of us: it is not our physical eyes that count, but our spiritual eyes. We are being asked to believe based on the eyewitness testimony of others. This is called “faith,” believing in something we cannot see with our normal senses. And our openness to the action of the Holy Spirit is called blessed by Jesus in the gospel -- “Blessed are they who have not seen, and have believed.” We can thank the Holy Spirit that this story about St. Thomas was preserved, so that we do not persist in unbelief.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** When we believe without “seeing,” we encounter the risen Lord and can say with Thomas, “My Lord and my God” (CCC #448). All of the disciples were doubtful, not just Thomas, and their faith was born under the action of divine grace as they experienced the reality of the risen Jesus (CCC #644). It is through believing that we have “life” in his name (CCC #514).\n\n---\n\n**Q469: It seems that Jesus Christ works in special ways in groups, after his Resurrection.**\n\nThe pervading thought in today’s two readings almost overwhelms us: we find Jesus in a special way in community! The First Reading (Acts 2:42-47) shows what can happen if we share our faith and make the spiritual journey together. We find people praying together regularly, celebrating Eucharist together regularly, and sharing their possessions with those in need. Is it any wonder that the loving witness of their lives should catch the attention of their neighbors, and lead to more conversions? Our Lord makes his presence known in such communities, including “signs and wonders” he works through them as a result of their faith.\n\nWe find the same communal setting occurring in the gospel (John 20:19-31). The difference seems to be that this time they are doing more than sharing bread and prayers; they are sharing fear! They are behind locked doors, afraid for their lives. Still, it is into this communal gathering that the Lord chooses to appear, providing the things that take away fear: his peace and the Holy Spirit!\n\nOne more gift is given to the community of apostles: the power to forgive sins! It is not only fear of physical harm that is removed by the peace of Jesus; now he removes fear of the afterlife. An avenue has been opened to continue the saving action of Jesus, through the Sacrament of Forgiveness!\n\nThe Easter Season is a special time to celebrate with one’s entire being this greatest of events in the history of the world, the Resurrection! Not only that, today on Divine Mercy Sunday we celebrate the love, forgiveness and mercy of Jesus – tender gifts that he longs to give to us freely, if we will only accept them!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Our Lord told Saint Faustina, “When you approach the confessional, know this, that I Myself am waiting there for you. I am only hidden by the priest, but I Myself act in your soul. Here the misery of the soul meets the God of mercy. Tell souls that from this fount of mercy souls draw graces solely with the vessel of trust. If their trust is great, there is no limit to My generosity.\" Pope John Paul II designated today ‘Divine Mercy Sunday’ on the occasion of Faustina’s canonization on April 30, 2000. Through the Sacrament of Confession, we are reconciled with God and the Body of Christ (CCC #1444).\n\n---\n\n**Lord, I do Believe, Help my Unbelief.**\n\nThese words in another Gospel passage were a petitioner's response when asked if he believed Jesus could cure his child. They could have been a fitting response for doubting Thomas and could be appropriate for us when we find following Christ difficult. The other apostles saw Jesus on Easter morn and they believed But their belief was not confined to words. They went out and shared their joy with others, doing good for the sick and possessed. When Thomas saw the Lord he responded with the most explicit confession of faith in John's Gospel: \"My Lord and my God!\" By Baptism we believe that we have been joined to Jesus in his death and resurrection. We are called to follow the example of the apostles even when that is hard to do.\n\n_Lord, I do believe. Help my unbelief and enable me to extend my self in practical ways to deepen that faith in helping others._",

All four things are closely related.</p>\n<p>One can approach this gospel in several ways. The easiest is to think of it in &#x201C;common sense&#x201D; terms from a 21st century viewpoint. We are Catholics who truly believe that Jesus is risen and is the Son of God. We do not need to see this with our own eyes; we simply accept the witness of the apostles and believe - thanks to the gift of faith! It is this very belief that automatically transforms us into a forgiving people - we are called to imitate the mercy and forgiveness of Jesus Christ. As a believing and forgiving people, we are then sent to spread this Good News of the risen Christ, and the divine mercy of our God. Some are called to do this vocally; everyone is called to do this by the way we live our lives.</p>\n<p>Jesus can transform all of our doubts into true belief, if we will let him. We must invite him into our lives, and ask him to &#x201C;increase our faith.&#x201D; The desire itself is the first step to being open to receive the gift of faith. The next step is to make that &#x201C;leap&#x201D; of trust, giving up our habit of trying to control the way things happen and simply depending on Jesus alone.

If we do not gather with the believing community and listen to God&#x2019;s inspired word, sharing our faith lives, then our faith will grow weak and fragile from lack of community support.

Not all of Abbot Benedict&apos;s monks live up to the ideal of personal poverty. Once a monk of his monastery gave a spiritual talk at a nearby convent of nuns. To express their thanks, the nuns gave him a few handkerchiefs.

Isn&apos;t it okay to seek real &quot;proof&quot;?</strong></p>\n<p>Faith itself is a pure gift from God to us, as well as our response to that offered gift. There is a great lesson in our gospel story today. It is this: Thomas was absent from the community when Jesus appeared. There is always a special Presence of Jesus when the community gathers in His name. We cannot benefit from that Presence if we are not there! God in His wisdom knows that alone we are fragmented; together we are united as a community of faith. This is part of the reason that God commanded the observance of the Sabbath Day by the community, gathered together in His name.</p>\n<p>The Holy Spirit blesses the community with all the gifts they need. But the entire community must be gathered to exercise all of the gifts. Different gifts are given to different people, as St. Paul taught the Corinthians, but they are not given to us for our own glory. Rather, the spiritual gifts are given so that we will use them to help others, to &quot;build up the body&quot; (1 Cor 12:1-26). If you are not present in the community, then you are depriving the community of your spiritual gifts.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere St. Paul teaches that faith comes from &quot;hearing&quot; and what is heard is the word of God. &quot;And how can they hear without someone to preach?&quot; (Rom 10:14b). Thomas could not believe at first, because he was not there in community when Jesus appeared. Today our faith depends upon this unity of community, which preserves the truth, that HE IS RISEN! The responsibility for protecting that Truth, and all other Truths that we receive from God&apos;s revelation, is lodged in the Magisterium, the official teaching Office of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Check your heart! If it is truly open to God&apos;s revelation through the Church that he established, then you will seek and find that truth in and through community. &quot;Peter&quot; (our Holy Father, the Pope) leads this community and continues to speak this Truth through official encyclicals, and provides a catechism to guide us in our spiritual growth. Ask yourself: how often have I opened my Catechism in the last few months? Start afresh by reading CCC #26 and 31-38 about &quot;proof.&quot;</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q524: Why do we pray to the Holy Spirit, asking him to enkindle in us the fire of divine love (opening prayer)?</strong></p>\n<p>Let&#x2019;s explore that question by looking at today&#x2019;s readings. Our gospel story is one of the most &#x201C;awesome&#x201D; and hope-filled incidents in the entire gospel (John 20:19-31)! Just think about the all-important context for a moment: the disciples are scared, behind locked doors. They all remember. Jesus had been betrayed by one of the twelve apostles, Judas. He had been rejected by the religious leaders who should have been able to recognize that Jesus was the Messiah, the fulfillment of the covenant promises to Israel. His closest group of friends deserted him in his final hours. The most prominent member of that group, Peter, even denied knowing him. He had been condemned by the civil authority, even though Pontius Pilate had announced the innocence of Jesus. And then he was tortured and killed in the most painful way known to first century dictators, by crucifixion. Events like those, in the language of the Hebrew scriptures, would seem to call for the &#x201C;traditional&#x201D; revenge by the blood clan &#x2013; or in the case of Jesus, the Son of God, through a justified rain of fire and brimstone. So perhaps those disciples were afraid of more than just persecution from the religious leaders? Did they not deserve to be &#x201C;zapped&#x201D; by lightning?</p>\n<p>But instead, what do we witness (in today&#x2019;s gospel story) after the glorious Resurrection of Jesus? He returns to his closest friends, itself a sign of mercy, and brings them the gift of peace. He forgives them, and empowers them to forgive others. He gives them the Holy Spirit, the very life of Christ himself &#x2013; and commissions them to continue his work! He is especially patient with Thomas, who insisted on &#x201C;evidence.&#x201D; And he implicitly gives each one of us the gift of Faith to believe in his Resurrection and his Sonship, without seeing him at all!</p>\n<p>That context and story speaks volumes about the mind-boggling Divine Mercy of our loving God, who is always faithful to his promises! All we can do is bow our heads in awe, beg forgiveness for our sins, and trust in his promised mercy. He is faithful to his promises!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>The gospels are written by those who were first to have faith, so that you, too, may believe that Jesus is the Christ (CCC #514). Action follows belief! Remember these commands of Jesus: be merciful, and love others as he loved us (CCC #2842). That is why we ask the Holy Spirit to kindle in us the fire of divine love!</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Peace Be with You</strong></p>\n<p>There is much food for reflection in today&#x2019;s readings. Let&#x2019;s just focus on Jesus&#x2019; greeting to is disciples, &#x201C;Peace be with you.&#x201D; Shalom, the Hebrew word for peace, was a conventional greeting in Jesus&#x2019; time. But Jesus uses it in a more profound sense; it is not just the absence of conflict. Shalom is that state of harmony and oneness with God and neighbor which Jesus came to establish. The reading from Acts gives us a vivid description of shalom/peace in action. It tells us that the &#x201C;community of believers was of one heart and mind and had everything in common&#x2026;there was no needy person among them.&quot; As the first letter of St. John put it in a passage before today&apos;s reading, &quot;let us love not in word or speech, but in deed and truth.&quot; While the early Christians did not always rise to these standards, they never forgot that the love of God demanded concern and commitment from every Christian for every Christian, and even for those who were not Christian.</p>\n<p><em>Lord, by baptism we have become one with Christ. Help us to make visible the love that binds us together in compassion, kindness, and patience, and in the courage to forgive and be forgiven. </em></p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

This is part of the reason that God commanded the observance of the Sabbath Day by the community, gathered together in His name.\n\nThe Holy Spirit blesses the community with all the gifts they need. But the entire community must be gathered to exercise all of the gifts. Different gifts are given to different people, as St. Paul taught the Corinthians, but they are not given to us for our own glory. Rather, the spiritual gifts are given so that we will use them to help others, to \"build up the body\" (1 Cor 12:1-26). If you are not present in the community, then you are depriving the community of your spiritual gifts.\n\nElsewhere St. Paul teaches that faith comes from \"hearing\" and what is heard is the word of God. \"And how can they hear without someone to preach?\" (Rom 10:14b). Thomas could not believe at first, because he was not there in community when Jesus appeared. Today our faith depends upon this unity of community, which preserves the truth, that HE IS RISEN! The responsibility for protecting that Truth, and all other Truths that we receive from God's revelation, is lodged in the Magisterium, the official teaching Office of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Check your heart! If it is truly open to God's revelation through the Church that he established, then you will seek and find that truth in and through community. \"Peter\" (our Holy Father, the Pope) leads this community and continues to speak this Truth through official encyclicals, and provides a catechism to guide us in our spiritual growth. Ask yourself: how often have I opened my Catechism in the last few months? Start afresh by reading CCC #26 and 31-38 about \"proof.\"\n\n---\n\n**Q524: Why do we pray to the Holy Spirit, asking him to enkindle in us the fire of divine love (opening prayer)?**\n\nLet’s explore that question by looking at today’s readings. Our gospel story is one of the most “awesome” and hope-filled incidents in the entire gospel (John 20:19-31)! Just think about the all-important context for a moment: the disciples are scared, behind locked doors. They all remember. Jesus had been betrayed by one of the twelve apostles, Judas. He had been rejected by the religious leaders who should have been able to recognize that Jesus was the Messiah, the fulfillment of the covenant promises to Israel. His closest group of friends deserted him in his final hours. The most prominent member of that group, Peter, even denied knowing him. He had been condemned by the civil authority, even though Pontius Pilate had announced the innocence of Jesus. And then he was tortured and killed in the most painful way known to first century dictators, by crucifixion. Events like those, in the language of the Hebrew scriptures, would seem to call for the “traditional” revenge by the blood clan – or in the case of Jesus, the Son of God, through a justified rain of fire and brimstone. So perhaps those disciples were afraid of more than just persecution from the religious leaders? Did they not deserve to be “zapped” by lightning?\n\nBut instead, what do we witness (in today’s gospel story) after the glorious Resurrection of Jesus? He returns to his closest friends, itself a sign of mercy, and brings them the gift of peace. He forgives them, and empowers them to forgive others. He gives them the Holy Spirit, the very life of Christ himself – and commissions them to continue his work! He is especially patient with Thomas, who insisted on “evidence.” And he implicitly gives each one of us the gift of Faith to believe in his Resurrection and his Sonship, without seeing him at all!\n\nThat context and story speaks volumes about the mind-boggling Divine Mercy of our loving God, who is always faithful to his promises! All we can do is bow our heads in awe, beg forgiveness for our sins, and trust in his promised mercy. He is faithful to his promises!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The gospels are written by those who were first to have faith, so that you, too, may believe that Jesus is the Christ (CCC #514). Action follows belief! Remember these commands of Jesus: be merciful, and love others as he loved us (CCC #2842). That is why we ask the Holy Spirit to kindle in us the fire of divine love!\n\n---\n\n**Peace Be with You**\n\nThere is much food for reflection in today’s readings. Let’s just focus on Jesus’ greeting to is disciples, “Peace be with you.” Shalom, the Hebrew word for peace, was a conventional greeting in Jesus’ time. But Jesus uses it in a more profound sense; it is not just the absence of conflict. Shalom is that state of harmony and oneness with God and neighbor which Jesus came to establish. The reading from Acts gives us a vivid description of shalom/peace in action. It tells us that the “community of believers was of one heart and mind and had everything in common…there was no needy person among them.\" As the first letter of St. John put it in a passage before today's reading, \"let us love not in word or speech, but in deed and truth.\" While the early Christians did not always rise to these standards, they never forgot that the love of God demanded concern and commitment from every Christian for every Christian, and even for those who were not Christian.\n\n_Lord, by baptism we have become one with Christ. Help us to make visible the love that binds us together in compassion, kindness, and patience, and in the courage to forgive and be forgiven._",

And a heavenly voice booms out, &quot;This is my beloved Son.

This Trinity comes to live within us at our Baptism, and the Transfiguration story reminds us of our destiny (CCC #556).

McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q307: What does Abraham&#x2019;s journey (Gen 12, First Reading) have to do with the story of the Transfiguration (Matt 17, Gospel)? Is there a connection?</strong></p>\n<p>This is one of those rare times when the Second Reading (2 Tim 1:8b-10) sheds light on the &#x201C;connection&#x201D; between the other two readings. St. Paul reminds Timothy (and us) that we have all been called to a daily life of holiness. We can&#x2019;t &#x201C;earn&#x201D; that holiness, that special close relationship with God; it is all grace that is given &#x201C;according to His own design.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Abraham lived his life by responding fully to God&#x2019;s call to journey with Him, and he responded whenever he heard His voice. He reacted without question, trusting completely in God. For that reason he is honored with the title &#x201C;father of our faith&#x201D; and extolled in Hebrews 11 for his faithfulness to God.</p>\n<p>In the story of the Transfiguration, Peter, James and John are chosen and privileged to be witnesses to Jesus&#x2019; self revelation as the divine Son of God, the beloved. They did not &#x201C;earn&#x201D; that privilege; it was sheer grace bestowed upon them, inviting them to an even deeper faith.</p>\n<p>You and I are also invited to this deeper faith. It begins with our baptism, when we are united with God in a very special way, and the Holy Spirit comes to dwell within us. He called us to be united with Him, and our baptism is, in fact, a union with His holiness. We are cleansed of all sin. The Transfiguration is really our own story, in one sense. We have become sons and daughters of God, Who loves us dearly and offers us eternal life and eternal union with Him. Our response to His invitation is the decisive element, a choice between eternal life or death.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Jesus chose this moment in his life to disclose his divinity to those he had called as witnesses (CCC #554-5). The Transfiguration gives us a foretaste of the glorious second coming of Christ and reminds us that we, too, will be transformed to become like him (CCC #556). It also strengthens us in our faith journey by building our hope (CCC #568).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>We Are Called</strong></p>\n<p>Abraham&apos;s call teaches us what faith is all about. He is called to leave everything he takes for granted and go who knows where -- God doesn&apos;t tell him. What does he do? What a person of true faith does: he hears and acts. He risks all, trusting that God will somehow fulfill his promises and blessings.</p>\n<p>In the transfigured Jesus we see a preview of where we are going on this journey of faith: to a transfigured humanity. But going down from the mountain he reminds us of the costs of this journey. Jesus, God&apos;s Son and servant, is called to be a suffering servant. The road to the final transfiguration goes by way of Mount Calvary. Paul reminds us of this when he calls us to join him in suffering for the Gospel.</p>\n<p><em>Almighty God and Father, you called Abraham to set out with confidence along the path of faith.. Deepen out faith so that we may follow in our lives the sufferings, death and resurrection of your Son, Jesus Christ, and so come to share in his risen glory.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p> \n\t\t",

But they should be treated not as a liability but as a distinct asset to society. Their presence reminds us of a past that had given us all we are. Their experience can help us to barge ahead more confidently into a future that has yet to come.\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q307: What does Abraham’s journey (Gen 12, First Reading) have to do with the story of the Transfiguration (Matt 17, Gospel)? Is there a connection?**\n\nThis is one of those rare times when the Second Reading (2 Tim 1:8b-10) sheds light on the “connection” between the other two readings. St. Paul reminds Timothy (and us) that we have all been called to a daily life of holiness. We can’t “earn” that holiness, that special close relationship with God; it is all grace that is given “according to His own design.”\n\nAbraham lived his life by responding fully to God’s call to journey with Him, and he responded whenever he heard His voice. He reacted without question, trusting completely in God. For that reason he is honored with the title “father of our faith” and extolled in Hebrews 11 for his faithfulness to God.\n\nIn the story of the Transfiguration, Peter, James and John are chosen and privileged to be witnesses to Jesus’ self revelation as the divine Son of God, the beloved. They did not “earn” that privilege; it was sheer grace bestowed upon them, inviting them to an even deeper faith.\n\nYou and I are also invited to this deeper faith. It begins with our baptism, when we are united with God in a very special way, and the Holy Spirit comes to dwell within us. He called us to be united with Him, and our baptism is, in fact, a union with His holiness. We are cleansed of all sin. The Transfiguration is really our own story, in one sense. We have become sons and daughters of God, Who loves us dearly and offers us eternal life and eternal union with Him. Our response to His invitation is the decisive element, a choice between eternal life or death.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Jesus chose this moment in his life to disclose his divinity to those he had called as witnesses (CCC #554-5). The Transfiguration gives us a foretaste of the glorious second coming of Christ and reminds us that we, too, will be transformed to become like him (CCC #556). It also strengthens us in our faith journey by building our hope (CCC #568).\n\n---\n\n**We Are Called**\n\nAbraham's call teaches us what faith is all about. He is called to leave everything he takes for granted and go who knows where -- God doesn't tell him. What does he do? What a person of true faith does: he hears and acts. He risks all, trusting that God will somehow fulfill his promises and blessings.\n\nIn the transfigured Jesus we see a preview of where we are going on this journey of faith: to a transfigured humanity. But going down from the mountain he reminds us of the costs of this journey. Jesus, God's Son and servant, is called to be a suffering servant. The road to the final transfiguration goes by way of Mount Calvary. Paul reminds us of this when he calls us to join him in suffering for the Gospel.\n\n_Almighty God and Father, you called Abraham to set out with confidence along the path of faith.. Deepen out faith so that we may follow in our lives the sufferings, death and resurrection of your Son, Jesus Christ, and so come to share in his risen glory._",

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>Citizenship In Heaven</strong></p>\n<p>Probably every American has read Edward Everett Hale&apos;s famous short story &quot;The Man Without A Country&quot;. It is pure fiction, but it has a touching realism. Here is the tale in summary, in case you have forgotten the details.</p>\n<p>In 1805 Aaron Burr, a former U.S. Vice-President was reported to be plotting to steal the American Southwest and set himself up as its king. The federal government tried him for treason, but the case against him was not proved.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, however, according to Hale&apos;s story, Burr won over several followers. Among them an enthusiastic young naval lieutenant, Philip Nolan. He was one of the lesser conspirators put on trial. Because of his youth, the judge of the court martial was ready to let him off. He asked Nolan if he wished to say anything to show that he had always been loyal to the United States. To the shock of all present, Nolan cursed his country. &quot;I wish I may never hear of the United States again!&quot;</p>\n<p>After that, the presiding officer could not release Nolan. Instead, he sentenced him to have his wish. Stripped of naval status and rank, he was ordered to be put on one navy vessel after another, and never be allowed to land on American soil. All personnel aboard the ships were cautioned never to mention the U.S.A. in his presence or to allow him to read anything about his homeland. The order was carried out almost perfectly. Philip Nolan spent from 1807 to 1863 as a &quot;man without a country&quot;. It was an excessive penalty, but he bore it heroically and came to realize gradually the meaning of patriotism.</p>\n<p>To be a citizen of some country is very important. Important practically, for it means that some government will protect us. Important psychologically because it is frightful to belong nowhere. A non-citizen is something like an astronaut whose &quot;umbilical cord&quot; is severed during a space walk, and who then becomes a lonely satellite whirling through space.</p>\n<p>But if earthly citizenship is necessary, heavenly citizenship is even more so. We must also be able to say with St. Paul &quot;We have our citizenship in heaven&quot; (Phil 3:20, today&apos;s second reading). One day we will stand at the gate of a border marked &quot;Kingdom of Heaven.&quot; When the guard asks &quot;Citizenship?&quot; we had better have our passports in order.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q413: Is the depiction today of the apostles&apos; struggle to stay awake really a picture of every Christian&apos;s journey?</strong></p>\n<p>Have you ever noticed how the three apostles (Peter, James and John) are always falling asleep on Jesus at critical moments in his journey to the cross? In today&apos;s gospel (Luke 9:28-36) Jesus reveals his divinity during the Transfiguration, surely a &#x201C;mountaintop experience&#x201D; to top them all! But &#x201C;Peter and his companions had been overcome by sleep&#x2026;&#x201D; Later on in another crucial moment near the end of Jesus&apos; journey at the Garden of Gethsemane, despite Jesus&apos; request to &#x201C;keep awake,&#x201D; Peter, James and John fall asleep during his hour of need (Mark 14:33-34, 37). During the Transfiguration when his glory was manifested, the three apostles woke up and heard a voice, &#x201C;This is my chosen Son; listen to him!&#x201D; Before they realized it, the &#x201C;mountaintop experience&#x201D; was over.</p>\n<p>In both cases, Jesus was engaged in deep prayer. In both cases, the apostles could not stay awake in prayer support. But once they realized what was happening at the Transfiguration, they wanted to stay there and continue the experience. St. Augustine taught us that instead Jesus took them back down the mountain, and showed them how to serve even through persecution - the Way to heaven lies through the Way of the Cross (CCC #556).</p>\n<p>I think we need to remember the stark contrast between last week&apos;s gospel and today&apos;s. In the story of the &#x201C;Temptations&#x201D; last week, we were reminded of the full humanity of Jesus. In the story of the &#x201C;Transfiguration&#x201D; today, we are reminded of the full divinity of Jesus. The latter reminds us of our promised eternal destiny when we respond to Jesus message of love. The former reminds us that this destiny doesn&apos;t mean we can avoid the trials and pains of life.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>In both the Transfiguration and the Gethsemane experiences, it is clear that the events are pointing to the Cross ahead, the way of suffering (CCC #555). Is it possible that we &#x201C;miss&#x201D; mountaintop experiences because we are not open to accepting the way of the cross that might be in our present or future? Jesus taught us to pray to our Father in heaven, &#x201C;Not my will but thine be done.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q569: Is there a connection between Abraham and Jesus in the readings today?</strong></p>\n<p>The readings today are quite revealing.

    "markdown": "**Citizenship In Heaven**\n\nProbably every American has read Edward Everett Hale's famous short story \"The Man Without A Country\". It is pure fiction, but it has a touching realism. Here is the tale in summary, in case you have forgotten the details.\n\nIn 1805 Aaron Burr, a former U.S. Vice-President was reported to be plotting to steal the American Southwest and set himself up as its king. The federal government tried him for treason, but the case against him was not proved.\n\nMeanwhile, however, according to Hale's story, Burr won over several followers. Among them an enthusiastic young naval lieutenant, Philip Nolan. He was one of the lesser conspirators put on trial. Because of his youth, the judge of the court martial was ready to let him off. He asked Nolan if he wished to say anything to show that he had always been loyal to the United States. To the shock of all present, Nolan cursed his country. \"I wish I may never hear of the United States again!\"\n\nAfter that, the presiding officer could not release Nolan. Instead, he sentenced him to have his wish. Stripped of naval status and rank, he was ordered to be put on one navy vessel after another, and never be allowed to land on American soil. All personnel aboard the ships were cautioned never to mention the U.S.A. in his presence or to allow him to read anything about his homeland. The order was carried out almost perfectly. Philip Nolan spent from 1807 to 1863 as a \"man without a country\". It was an excessive penalty, but he bore it heroically and came to realize gradually the meaning of patriotism.\n\nTo be a citizen of some country is very important. Important practically, for it means that some government will protect us. Important psychologically because it is frightful to belong nowhere. A non-citizen is something like an astronaut whose \"umbilical cord\" is severed during a space walk, and who then becomes a lonely satellite whirling through space.\n\nBut if earthly citizenship is necessary, heavenly citizenship is even more so. We must also be able to say with St. Paul \"We have our citizenship in heaven\" (Phil 3:20, today's second reading). One day we will stand at the gate of a border marked \"Kingdom of Heaven.\" When the guard asks \"Citizenship?\" we had better have our passports in order.\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q413: Is the depiction today of the apostles' struggle to stay awake really a picture of every Christian's journey?**\n\nHave you ever noticed how the three apostles (Peter, James and John) are always falling asleep on Jesus at critical moments in his journey to the cross? In today's gospel (Luke 9:28-36) Jesus reveals his divinity during the Transfiguration, surely a “mountaintop experience” to top them all! But “Peter and his companions had been overcome by sleep…” Later on in another crucial moment near the end of Jesus' journey at the Garden of Gethsemane, despite Jesus' request to “keep awake,” Peter, James and John fall asleep during his hour of need (Mark 14:33-34, 37). During the Transfiguration when his glory was manifested, the three apostles woke up and heard a voice, “This is my chosen Son; listen to him!” Before they realized it, the “mountaintop experience” was over.\n\nIn both cases, Jesus was engaged in deep prayer. In both cases, the apostles could not stay awake in prayer support. But once they realized what was happening at the Transfiguration, they wanted to stay there and continue the experience. St. Augustine taught us that instead Jesus took them back down the mountain, and showed them how to serve even through persecution - the Way to heaven lies through the Way of the Cross (CCC #556).\n\nI think we need to remember the stark contrast between last week's gospel and today's. In the story of the “Temptations” last week, we were reminded of the full humanity of Jesus. In the story of the “Transfiguration” today, we are reminded of the full divinity of Jesus. The latter reminds us of our promised eternal destiny when we respond to Jesus message of love. The former reminds us that this destiny doesn't mean we can avoid the trials and pains of life.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** In both the Transfiguration and the Gethsemane experiences, it is clear that the events are pointing to the Cross ahead, the way of suffering (CCC #555). Is it possible that we “miss” mountaintop experiences because we are not open to accepting the way of the cross that might be in our present or future? Jesus taught us to pray to our Father in heaven, “Not my will but thine be done.”\n\n---\n\n**Q569: Is there a connection between Abraham and Jesus in the readings today?**\n\nThe readings today are quite revealing. First, Abraham is transformed from a desert nomad into the father of a great nation, because of his faithful listening (Gen. 15:5-18). Then Jesus is transfigured from what his disciples thought was merely an itinerant preacher into the Savior of the world (Luke 9:28-36).\n\nIt has been said (S. DeGidio, OSM) that transfiguration happens when some inner quality or hidden potential of a person comes to light. Each one of us has a special quality and hidden potential, as a baptized Christian. We are called to use actively that special relationship that we have with the Christ who now dwells within us. It must not lie dormant, because the Lord has given each one of us a mission to spread the good news of his love and his redemption, and to invite others into his kingdom.\n\nIt is in the reception of Holy Eucharist that we are enabled to become transformed into His image, to become fully human as he wants us to be. As Jesus teaches us, we have no life within us if we do not eat the Bread of Life, the medicine of immortality (John 6; CCC #2837).\n\nIt is important to realize the context of our gospel story. Jesus was at prayer. During this prayer his transfiguration took place, and a divine voice tells the disciples—and us—to listen to this chosen, prayerful Son. In other words, we do not stop with our reflection upon the transfiguration. We need to take the next step and actively live the life of a true disciple, pondering the teachings of Jesus and actively living the Christ-life in our world.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** As with Abraham and Jesus, prayerful listening is our own ‘mountain’ into the divine presence. Jesus always prays before the decisive moments and events in his life and mission, as well as before decisive moments involving his disciples. Can we imitate his trusting and humble commitment to his Father’s will (CCC #2600)?\n\n---\n\n**The Best Is Yet to Come**\n\nGod promised the childless and landless Abraham a host of descendants and possession of the land of Canaan. Abraham trusts in the Lord to keep his promise even though he does not understand how it will happen. St. Paul tells us that by baptism we have become citizens of heaven even though we live as expatriates here.

McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q551: Miracles and healings like the one for blind Bartimeus don&#x2019;t seem to happen much these days. Is there a lesson here?</strong></p>\n<p>Today&#x2019;s gospel scene (Mark 10:46-52) reminds me of the peaceful tea parties that are being conducted by concerned protesters against perceived political abuses and perceived political blindness to social injustice. Many politicians can see physically, but are spiritually blind to what their policies and practices are doing to themselves and to others.</p>\n<p>In this gospel case, the protest is against physical blindness, and the inability to do anything about it except call out hopefully for change. As expected, the bystanders verbally condemn or rebuke the protester. But Jesus sees the faith of Bartimaeus. Because of his faith, with faith&#x2019;s focus on Jesus, he is healed.</p>\n<p>What a paradox, one that is meaningful today at many levels! On the one hand a blind man named Bartimaeus cannot see physically, but can see spiritually because of his focus on Jesus. At the other extreme a self-serving politician named Senator can see physically, but is spiritually dead because he or she has lost his or her focus on Jesus!</p>\n<p>Healings can take many forms. God empowers certain people by gifting them with skills that enable successful surgery, transplants, genetic research, and so on. God also enables others to use their gift of wisdom to select political representatives who will not blindly throw God out of the culture, but will instead base their decisions for the common good on God&#x2019;s will. Those who can see with the eyes of God, with their spiritual eyes, are the ones who are doing the will of God. YOU are the one who enables the politician of your choice. Are YOU choosing wisely? Do your elected representatives&#x2019; votes in Congress reflect God&#x2019;s will?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Jesus always responds to a prayer offered in faith (CCC #2616), and this gives us continuing hope. We need to cry out humbly for mercy for our own spiritual blindness, as well as the spiritual blindness (or perceived arrogance) of many of our politicians (CCC #2667).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Lord That I May See</strong></p>\n<p>For the last six Sundays we have followed Jesus on his journey to Jerusalem. On the way he has been teaching his disciples, and us, about who he is and what it means to follow him. Today, as we near the end of the journey, Jesus meets the blind man, Bartimaeus . He hears Jesus approach and begins to believe and hope that Jesus can heal him. He calls out ,&quot;Jesus, son of David have pity on me.&quot; It is not just a request for healing but it is also an act of faith. He recognizes Jesus as the Son of David, the messiah. Even when everybody tries to silence him he persists. Jesus calls him and asks what he wants. &quot;Master, that I may see.&quot; That is what we all want -- to see Jesus and the healing he offers us. Jesus responds, &quot;Your faith has saved you.&quot; Bartimaeus comes to see not only in a physical sense but on the spiritual level. His response to his healing is to follow Jesus on the way, which we know leads to Jerusalem, to his passion and death. His encounter with Jesus is a model for all who would follow the way of Jesus, where it leads to and what comes with it.</p>\n<p><em>Lord, you came to bring light to those who live in darkness. We thank you for the gift of faith and sight. Help us to see what is important in our lives and how to be faithful to it.

Is there a lesson here?**\n\nToday’s gospel scene (Mark 10:46-52) reminds me of the peaceful tea parties that are being conducted by concerned protesters against perceived political abuses and perceived political blindness to social injustice. Many politicians can see physically, but are spiritually blind to what their policies and practices are doing to themselves and to others.\n\nIn this gospel case, the protest is against physical blindness, and the inability to do anything about it except call out hopefully for change. As expected, the bystanders verbally condemn or rebuke the protester. But Jesus sees the faith of Bartimaeus. Because of his faith, with faith’s focus on Jesus, he is healed.\n\nWhat a paradox, one that is meaningful today at many levels! On the one hand a blind man named Bartimaeus cannot see physically, but can see spiritually because of his focus on Jesus. At the other extreme a self-serving politician named Senator can see physically, but is spiritually dead because he or she has lost his or her focus on Jesus!\n\nHealings can take many forms. God empowers certain people by gifting them with skills that enable successful surgery, transplants, genetic research, and so on. God also enables others to use their gift of wisdom to select political representatives who will not blindly throw God out of the culture, but will instead base their decisions for the common good on God’s will. Those who can see with the eyes of God, with their spiritual eyes, are the ones who are doing the will of God. YOU are the one who enables the politician of your choice. Are YOU choosing wisely? Do your elected representatives’ votes in Congress reflect God’s will?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Jesus always responds to a prayer offered in faith (CCC #2616), and this gives us continuing hope. We need to cry out humbly for mercy for our own spiritual blindness, as well as the spiritual blindness (or perceived arrogance) of many of our politicians (CCC #2667).\n\n---\n\n**Lord That I May See**\n\nFor the last six Sundays we have followed Jesus on his journey to Jerusalem. On the way he has been teaching his disciples, and us, about who he is and what it means to follow him. Today, as we near the end of the journey, Jesus meets the blind man, Bartimaeus . He hears Jesus approach and begins to believe and hope that Jesus can heal him. He calls out ,\"Jesus, son of David have pity on me.\" It is not just a request for healing but it is also an act of faith. He recognizes Jesus as the Son of David, the messiah. Even when everybody tries to silence him he persists. Jesus calls him and asks what he wants. \"Master, that I may see.\" That is what we all want -- to see Jesus and the healing he offers us. Jesus responds, \"Your faith has saved you.\" Bartimaeus comes to see not only in a physical sense but on the spiritual level. His response to his healing is to follow Jesus on the way, which we know leads to Jerusalem, to his passion and death. His encounter with Jesus is a model for all who would follow the way of Jesus, where it leads to and what comes with it.\n\n_Lord, you came to bring light to those who live in darkness. We thank you for the gift of faith and sight. Help us to see what is important in our lives and how to be faithful to it. Help us to see the needs of others and be quick to offer our help_.",

Several years after their marriage, when it seemed as though God intended them to be childless, they adopted a baby boy. After a while they decided that they should adopt a girl, too.</p>\n<p>Among those available for adoption, there was one sweet child who had a cardiac disorder. Because of the ailment, the physician who examined the little girl advised against taking her.</p>\n<p>To the doctor&apos;s amazement, Bill disagreed. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;we&apos;ll adopt her anyhow. A daughter of ours might have been born with the same condition.&quot;</p>\n<p>After sixteen years of marriage, Bill and Billie welcomed a third child into their family circle. This baby was their own flesh and blood.... God&apos;s way of saying thank you?</p>\n<p>The second commandment is like the first: &quot;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; (Matthew 22:39. Gospel of the day).</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>A186: The gospel (Matt 22:34-40) says to &quot;love God and love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; Sounds easy, but I really worry -- how do I know that I am loving my neighbor?</strong></p>\n<p>The gospel story today occurs in the middle of a longer exchange (22:15 - 23:36). First the scribes try more than once to &quot;trap&quot; Jesus into making a mistake, by asking him tricky questions. Then Jesus denounces them (those terrible &quot;Woe to you...&quot; charges) and their practices that are both sinfully proud and needlessly burdensome. Those &quot;woes&quot; are aimed at hypocrites who use a rule book against others, but themselves miss the command to love their neighbor.</p>\n<p>No church practice or rule should ever be a burden, and in our Catholic Church, none are. They are there to help us keep those two &quot;biggies&quot; (love of God and neighbor), and also to teach us how to avoid everything that is opposed to the &quot;love command&quot; - in other words, to avoid sin.</p>\n<p>Isn&apos;t the Cross and Resurrection the most important historical event in your life? If so, how much effort do you put into your love relationship with God, into your response to His demonstrated love? (&quot;Once a week&quot; is not the desired answer.) Every wise priest says that your love for God is tested and put into practice by the way you love your neighbor. Love is both a choice and an attitude &#x2013; it recognizes how all relationships need to be, and then acts accordingly! Read the First Reading again for this Sunday (Ex 22:20-26), which calls our attention to society&apos;s biggest needs (such as immigrants without legal status, widows who have no help, street people, the poor who are forced to borrow, the powerless). When we observe God&apos;s religious laws, it has social consequences and also shows our gratitude to Him for Saving us. Today, would Jesus say &quot;Woe to you...&quot; regarding your actions or your inaction? Did the heavenly &quot;Love Boat&quot; leave port without you?</p>\n<p><strong>Spirituality &amp; Action</strong>: Within your family circle, see if you can figure out how the command to &quot;love God&quot; is all about faith, hope and charity; and next read CCC #2086. Then, pick out a neighbor, someone you don&apos;t know very well who lives nearby, and discuss how to surprise them with an act of kindness (without their ever finding out who did it) such as raking, shoveling, baking, or even praying a family rosary for their spiritual wellbeing.

All of the laws, and all of the words of the prophets, have their foundation in one thing: Love. They are designed to help humans do the most lovable thing in their relationships, both with God and with other humans. Accordingly, Jesus wisely advises the Pharisees that the greatest and first command is to love God totally, faithfully, and without reservation. Not even a Pharisee can disagree with that wisdom! But not only that, there is still another command &#x201C;like it,&#x201D; to love your neighbor as yourself.

Not really. We cannot love God and not love our neighbor, but there is more to it than that. The love of God has priority and is the source of love for neighbor.

I can see my neighbor and his needs, and hopefully respond to them. But how do I love the invisible and transcendent God?

Several years after their marriage, when it seemed as though God intended them to be childless, they adopted a baby boy. After a while they decided that they should adopt a girl, too.\n\nAmong those available for adoption, there was one sweet child who had a cardiac disorder. Because of the ailment, the physician who examined the little girl advised against taking her.\n\nTo the doctor's amazement, Bill disagreed. \"No,\" he said, \"we'll adopt her anyhow. A daughter of ours might have been born with the same condition.\"\n\nAfter sixteen years of marriage, Bill and Billie welcomed a third child into their family circle. This baby was their own flesh and blood.... God's way of saying thank you?\n\nThe second commandment is like the first: \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" (Matthew 22:39. Gospel of the day).\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**A186: The gospel (Matt 22:34-40) says to \"love God and love your neighbor as yourself.\" Sounds easy, but I really worry -- how do I know that I am loving my neighbor?**\n\nThe gospel story today occurs in the middle of a longer exchange (22:15 - 23:36). First the scribes try more than once to \"trap\" Jesus into making a mistake, by asking him tricky questions. Then Jesus denounces them (those terrible \"Woe to you...\" charges) and their practices that are both sinfully proud and needlessly burdensome. Those \"woes\" are aimed at hypocrites who use a rule book against others, but themselves miss the command to love their neighbor.\n\nNo church practice or rule should ever be a burden, and in our Catholic Church, none are. They are there to help us keep those two \"biggies\" (love of God and neighbor), and also to teach us how to avoid everything that is opposed to the \"love command\" - in other words, to avoid sin.\n\nIsn't the Cross and Resurrection the most important historical event in your life? If so, how much effort do you put into your love relationship with God, into your response to His demonstrated love? (\"Once a week\" is not the desired answer.) Every wise priest says that your love for God is tested and put into practice by the way you love your neighbor. Love is both a choice and an attitude – it recognizes how all relationships need to be, and then acts accordingly! Read the First Reading again for this Sunday (Ex 22:20-26), which calls our attention to society's biggest needs (such as immigrants without legal status, widows who have no help, street people, the poor who are forced to borrow, the powerless). When we observe God's religious laws, it has social consequences and also shows our gratitude to Him for Saving us. Today, would Jesus say \"Woe to you...\" regarding your actions or your inaction? Did the heavenly \"Love Boat\" leave port without you?\n\n**Spirituality & Action**: Within your family circle, see if you can figure out how the command to \"love God\" is all about faith, hope and charity; and next read CCC #2086. Then, pick out a neighbor, someone you don't know very well who lives nearby, and discuss how to surprise them with an act of kindness (without their ever finding out who did it) such as raking, shoveling, baking, or even praying a family rosary for their spiritual wellbeing. Next, read CCC #2196. Cultivate the \"love habit\" by sharing with each other ways we could \"love our neighbor\" at the office, school or neighborhood, and within our own family.\n\n---\n\n**Q499: How can the Pharisees be planning a “trap,” when the topic is simply the Commandments?**\n\nLast Sunday (Matthew 22:15-21) we saw the Pharisees team up with the Herodians to try to “trap” Jesus regarding the issue of paying the hated Roman census tax.

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>Q291: Is Zacchaeus trying to &quot;buy&quot; his way in to the Kingdom of God (Lk 19:1-10)?</strong></p>\n<p>I&apos;ve often thought that this whole section of Luke&apos;s gospel (say, 18:9 - 19:10) could be called &quot;The Pride of the Rich,&quot; or some such title. In that segment we hear the following stories: a self-righteous Pharisee tells God how much better he is than the tax collector; Jesus teaches about the need for childlike simplicity; a very rich official refuses to part with his possessions; Jesus uses the &quot;camel through the eye of the needle&quot; comparison about the difficulties the wealthy face; and finally, a rich sinner gets it right and repents (Zacchaeus).</p>\n<p>The gospel today (Lk 19:1-10) is not just entertainment about a short fat bald man climbing a tree and later trying to &quot;buy&quot; his salvation. Rather, it is about the radical changes that everyone must make when Jesus issues an invitation. Zacchaeus was also a very rich man and a hated tax collector, a collaborator with the occupying Roman empire. And yet, this is the man that Jesus said he was going to dine with. Even more surprising, it was Jesus who initiated the contact. We know that such an action would have been unthinkable for a Pharisee, and indeed they all &quot;grumbled.&quot;</p>\n<p>Jesus called Zacchaeus a &quot;descendant of Abraham&quot; (19:9), which both restored the dignity of true community identity for this tax collector, and which indicated that all were sinners, not just Zacchaeus. So that there is no mistake, Jesus concludes &quot;the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost&quot; (19:10). In Luke&apos;s gospel, Jesus is constantly breaking down barriers which prevent the exchange of love and compassion. All he asks of us is that we allow him to come into our homes and hearts, and spend some time with him. Are we, like Zacchaeus, open enough to want to &quot;see&quot; Jesus, and to &quot;do&quot; something to facilitate that encounter?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> A &quot;forgiven&quot; sinner responds by welcoming the love that is offered, and returning that love (CCC #2712); prayer is the normal avenue of exchange. Injustice requires reparation, which Jesus blessed in today&apos;s story (CCC #2412). Wealth can become a form of slavery to sin, unless it is used according to God&apos;s will (CCC #549).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q448: Is Zacchaeus in today&#x2019;s gospel (Luke 19:1-10) supposed to be a role model of some sort for Catholics?</strong></p>\n<p>There is an old Christian legend (whose source I have been unable able to find) that tells how Zacchaeus, every day after his encounter with Jesus, would take a bucket of water and pour it on the base of that famous tree in Jericho. It had now become a sacred sign to him, a place of sacred encounter in that furnace-like desert, and so in deep gratitude he reverenced that sacred location every day thereafter.</p>\n<p>Have you ever &#x201C;gone out on a limb&#x201D; for something or someone? Or as we used to say when I was growing up in rural Nebraska, have you ever &#x201C;bet the farm&#x201D; on a specific belief? Zacchaeus did that when he was converted on his first encounter with Jesus. Not only did he believe in Jesus, he now made four-fold restitution because of that belief, and also gave half of his possessions to the poor. He risked everything, including his future income stream (which now would undoubtedly dwindle considerably). His actions would surely qualify as a model to follow.</p>\n<p>I presume that you are a baptized Christian, a believer, otherwise you would not be reading this article. You have been given the precious gift of God&#x2019;s Presence dwelling right within you! You don&#x2019;t have to go out and climb a tree; all you have to do is accept the gift; look within, and then &#x201C;bet the farm&#x201D; on what you believe. That means you are called to &#x201C;risk everything&#x201D; to become His disciple, and to live as he wants you to live, to become more fully the image you were created to be &#x2013; His image!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Zacchaeus&#x2019; response to Jesus could be summed up this way: &#x201C;I firmly resolve, with the help of your grace, to confess my sins, do penance, and amend my life. Amen!&#x201D; The Sacrament of Penance is a &#x201C;place&#x201D; where Jesus makes available to Catholics his call to conversion &#x2013; thus it is called the sacrament of conversion (CCC #1423). Get out of your tree, your stubborn way of life, and &#x201C;bet the farm&#x201D; that this is also a sacrament of forgiveness and reconciliation (CCC #1424)! Allow salvation to come to your &#x201C;house&#x201D;!</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>You Have Mercy on All Because You Love All That You Have created</strong></p>\n<p>The Book of Wisdom reminds us that all God&apos;s creation is good. Things become evil only when used in ways contrary to God&apos;s intent. St. Paul reminds us that it is God&apos;s gift that enables us to carry out our good intentions and to use his creation in accord with God&apos;s will. Finally, St. Luke tells us that even the sinner, the weak and despised has value in God&apos;s sight and can respond to his call.</p>\n<p><em>Lord, help us to see the goodness in everyone you have created. Help us to use your gifts in the way you intended and help us to see and welcome the poor, the despised, even sinners as your sons and daughters, the work of your hands.</em></p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

In that segment we hear the following stories: a self-righteous Pharisee tells God how much better he is than the tax collector; Jesus teaches about the need for childlike simplicity; a very rich official refuses to part with his possessions; Jesus uses the \"camel through the eye of the needle\" comparison about the difficulties the wealthy face; and finally, a rich sinner gets it right and repents (Zacchaeus).\n\nThe gospel today (Lk 19:1-10) is not just entertainment about a short fat bald man climbing a tree and later trying to \"buy\" his salvation. Rather, it is about the radical changes that everyone must make when Jesus issues an invitation. Zacchaeus was also a very rich man and a hated tax collector, a collaborator with the occupying Roman empire. And yet, this is the man that Jesus said he was going to dine with. Even more surprising, it was Jesus who initiated the contact. We know that such an action would have been unthinkable for a Pharisee, and indeed they all \"grumbled.\"\n\nJesus called Zacchaeus a \"descendant of Abraham\" (19:9), which both restored the dignity of true community identity for this tax collector, and which indicated that all were sinners, not just Zacchaeus. So that there is no mistake, Jesus concludes \"the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost\" (19:10). In Luke's gospel, Jesus is constantly breaking down barriers which prevent the exchange of love and compassion. All he asks of us is that we allow him to come into our homes and hearts, and spend some time with him. Are we, like Zacchaeus, open enough to want to \"see\" Jesus, and to \"do\" something to facilitate that encounter?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** A \"forgiven\" sinner responds by welcoming the love that is offered, and returning that love (CCC #2712); prayer is the normal avenue of exchange. Injustice requires reparation, which Jesus blessed in today's story (CCC #2412). Wealth can become a form of slavery to sin, unless it is used according to God's will (CCC #549).\n\n---\n\n**Q448: Is Zacchaeus in today’s gospel (Luke 19:1-10) supposed to be a role model of some sort for Catholics?**\n\nThere is an old Christian legend (whose source I have been unable able to find) that tells how Zacchaeus, every day after his encounter with Jesus, would take a bucket of water and pour it on the base of that famous tree in Jericho. It had now become a sacred sign to him, a place of sacred encounter in that furnace-like desert, and so in deep gratitude he reverenced that sacred location every day thereafter.\n\nHave you ever “gone out on a limb” for something or someone? Or as we used to say when I was growing up in rural Nebraska, have you ever “bet the farm” on a specific belief? Zacchaeus did that when he was converted on his first encounter with Jesus. Not only did he believe in Jesus, he now made four-fold restitution because of that belief, and also gave half of his possessions to the poor. He risked everything, including his future income stream (which now would undoubtedly dwindle considerably). His actions would surely qualify as a model to follow.\n\nI presume that you are a baptized Christian, a believer, otherwise you would not be reading this article. You have been given the precious gift of God’s Presence dwelling right within you! You don’t have to go out and climb a tree; all you have to do is accept the gift; look within, and then “bet the farm” on what you believe. That means you are called to “risk everything” to become His disciple, and to live as he wants you to live, to become more fully the image you were created to be – His image!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Zacchaeus’ response to Jesus could be summed up this way: “I firmly resolve, with the help of your grace, to confess my sins, do penance, and amend my life. Amen!” The Sacrament of Penance is a “place” where Jesus makes available to Catholics his call to conversion – thus it is called the sacrament of conversion (CCC #1423). Get out of your tree, your stubborn way of life, and “bet the farm” that this is also a sacrament of forgiveness and reconciliation (CCC #1424)! Allow salvation to come to your “house”!\n\n---\n\n**You Have Mercy on All Because You Love All That You Have created**\n\nThe Book of Wisdom reminds us that all God's creation is good. Things become evil only when used in ways contrary to God's intent. St. Paul reminds us that it is God's gift that enables us to carry out our good intentions and to use his creation in accord with God's will. Finally, St. Luke tells us that even the sinner, the weak and despised has value in God's sight and can respond to his call.\n\n_Lord, help us to see the goodness in everyone you have created. Help us to use your gifts in the way you intended and help us to see and welcome the poor, the despised, even sinners as your sons and daughters, the work of your hands._",

Those who sneer at it do so perhaps because they have never understood its motives.</p>\n<p>Aloysius was born in 1568, the elder son of Ferrante Gonzaga, Marquis of Castiglione in northern Italy. As a nobleman&apos;s son, he was a boy-functionary in the court of the Duke of Mantua, and later on in Spain a page in the court of the crown prince. This was intended to prepare him to succeed his father as Marquis.</p>\n<p>Italian-court life in those days, however glamorous it appeared to be, was melodramatically bad: &quot;a society of fraud, dagger, poison and lust of the most hideous kind.&quot; Youngsters born into this aggressive atmosphere quickly learned about the seamy side of life. By the time Louis was only nine, he was using every means of self-discipline he could think of to keep pure in body and heart. But his desire soon went farther. He wanted to make a complete break and vow himself to celibate chastity - that is, to not marrying - as a priest. He therefore entered the order of Jesuits when eighteen, despite his father&apos;s initial objections. Six years later he died. Though not yet ordained a priest, he had taken his vow of chastity and grown very close to God. His death stemmed from his efforts at nursing victims of the plague. During his last illness Aloysius spoke only of heavenly things; and as death approached he said, &quot;We are going - gladly, gladly!&quot;</p>\n<p>Most people, Catholic lay persons included, do not fully comprehend the celibacy of priests or religious, or even of lay Catholics who have chosen to vow not to marry. If good people fail to understand this, it is because God has not given them the gift, which he gives to relatively few. The celibate&apos;s motive is this: marriage and child-bearing are a divine pleasure and privilege; but they are very temporary. As Jesus says in today&apos;s gospel, marriage and begetting belong to this world, not the next. So those gifted with celibate chastity say to the rest of us: Marry if you will, and God prosper you! I, with God&apos;s help, will hold off, in anticipation of heaven.</p>\n<p>Celibate priests, sisters, brothers and vowed lay persons, whether they realize it or not, thus become constant signs to the rest of mankind. By their self-denial they remind us that there is a heaven awaiting the &quot;sons of God.&quot; In that heaven even the greatest joys of earthly married love will be seen to have been only like the light of a flickering candle in the brightness of the noonday sun.</p>\n<p>-Fr. Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q292: Why is it necessary to speak of the &quot;resurrection of the body&quot; as an Article of Faith?</strong></p>\n<p>This article of our Catholic Creed was originally designed to counter the false teachings of Greek philosophers on the subject. The Greek pagan thinkers just may have been influenced by oriental philosophies such as Buddhism, which found one outlet in Gnosticism - holding a &quot;dualistic&quot; view that contrasted the importance of body versus soul. The conclusion of these pagans was that only the spirit or &quot;soul&quot; counted; &quot;body&quot; was not important.</p>\n<p>In the monotheistic world of Israel, only the Sadducees (conservative priestly aristocracy) did not believe in the resurrection of the body, since they could find no compelling evidence of that in the Torah (Hebrew scriptures). The Pharisees, however, did believe based on the full Septuagint (Greek scriptures), such as Daniel 12:2. Jesus is clear that the laws of this world no longer hold after the resurrection from the dead. In addition, his answer affirms a bodily resurrection, and affirms that a whole person, with all its natural faculties, is raised to an other-worldly existence. Bodily happiness belongs to complete happiness for an Israelite. Hence the promise of God to the patriarchs (Gen 15:1ff) cannot be fulfilled by a life that ends with death. Jesus&apos; answer is a consequence of God&apos;s faithfulness to his covenant, and affirms the dignity of humankind in its fullness.</p>\n<p>In terms of the New Testament, it seems to me that the belief in the general resurrection perhaps finds its best expression in John 5, especially 5:25 and 5:28. Belief or disbelief in Jesus is the factor through which we decide on our future destiny right now.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> One resource you could review is &quot;The Creed in the Gospels&quot; by Fr. Alfons Kemmer (Paulist Press) which tracks the arguments above. Our Catechism of the Catholic Church adheres faithfully to the teaching of Jesus, to St. Paul, and to the Ecumenical Councils, that &quot;resurrection of the body&quot; means the soul will live on after death, and our &apos;mortal bodies&apos; will come to life again (CCC #990). If there is no resurrection, our faith is in vain (CCC #991).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q605: There has to be a deeper issue involved in today&#x2019;s Gospel than a discussion of multiple spouses in heaven!</strong></p>\n<p>If there ever was a political or religious hidden agenda, it is surely manifested in our Gospel today (Luke 20:27-38). The Sadducees pose a question to Jesus involving the laws governing inheritance rights and levirate laws. However, the main theme is not about inheritances left to one&#x2019;s posterity. Rather, it is the Sadducees&#x2019; attempt to trap Jesus with an absurd situation. They did not believe in the resurrection because they could not find anything about it in the Torah. Therefore, they thought they had Jesus in a no-win situation and could prevail in any argument about the resurrection. Needless to say, Jesus knew the Torah better than they did, and pointed them to the relevant passages about life after death.</p>\n<p>For a Christian disciple, today&#x2019;s First Reading (2 Macc 7:1-2, 9-14) and Gospel combine to speak about our belief in Jesus and belief in his teachings&#x2014;especially his teachings which lead to our hope in the resurrection of our own bodies. If we hold fast in faith to the teachings of Christ and his Church, we can face any adversity&#x2014;even to the extent of paying the ultimate price for our beliefs like the Maccabees family.</p>\n<p>Now, it may be hard to connect our lives to the situations of the Sadducees and the Maccabees. But think about this: it is simply about living our discipleship by clinging faithfully to the foundational principles that Jesus taught us. Those include the holiness of the sacred marriage bond between a man and a woman; the sanctity of all life from womb to tomb; justice for those we call marginalized and poor; and honesty in the political and economic world. Look around: those things are invisible today in the sick public segment of our culture! So you will be held up to public ridicule if you object to abortion; object to so-called gay marriages; object to destructive competition; and object to lying and deceptive politicians.</p>\n<p>It is our trust in Jesus and hope in the resurrection that enables us to defend our principles in the public forum, no matter what the cost. Read and heed the signs of our times!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> By St. Augustine&#x2019;s time, Christian faith had met with more opposition on the subject of our bodily resurrection than on any other topic (CCC 996). Just how this resurrection will happen is beyond our imagination and understanding (CCC 1000).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>What Shall We Be?</strong></p>\n<p>The seven brothers in the Book of Maccabees gained strength to face martyrdom from their belief in the resurrection of the just. God had created them and sustained them; would he let their fidelity and suffering go for nothing? No! But their view of resurrection seems to be that it will be very much like this life -- more of the same.</p>\n<p>The Gospel story clarifies the nature of the resurrected life. The Sadducees rejected the idea of resurrection of the body because they could find no reference to it in the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament, the only Scripture they accepted. They used their Torah law on widow&apos;s marriages to make the idea of the resurrection look silly. It would be intolerable for the for the seven brothers to have one wife in the resurrection, so there can be no resurrection.</p>\n<p>Jesus responds with the Torah&apos;s reference to God speaking to Moses as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For the Jews God is not just the one they prayed to, but the God who calls them and saves them. If Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are simply dead, then their god isn&apos;t much of a savior. A God only of the dead is no god at all. This is Jesus&apos; implicit argument. More important for us is his teaching that the resurrected life of the body is not material but a transformed life. Jesus doesn&apos;t say what this transformed life will be like, nor do other biblical books. The first epistle of St. John (3: 1-3), for instance, says &quot;We are God&apos;s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed &quot;we will be like him for we will see him as he is.&quot; St. Paul uses the experience of a seed being transformed in to a plant and its blossom as an image of the transformation of the material body in to a spiritual body.</p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

This was intended to prepare him to succeed his father as Marquis.\n\nItalian-court life in those days, however glamorous it appeared to be, was melodramatically bad: \"a society of fraud, dagger, poison and lust of the most hideous kind.\" Youngsters born into this aggressive atmosphere quickly learned about the seamy side of life. By the time Louis was only nine, he was using every means of self-discipline he could think of to keep pure in body and heart. But his desire soon went farther. He wanted to make a complete break and vow himself to celibate chastity - that is, to not marrying - as a priest. He therefore entered the order of Jesuits when eighteen, despite his father's initial objections. Six years later he died. Though not yet ordained a priest, he had taken his vow of chastity and grown very close to God. His death stemmed from his efforts at nursing victims of the plague. During his last illness Aloysius spoke only of heavenly things; and as death approached he said, \"We are going - gladly, gladly!\"\n\nMost people, Catholic lay persons included, do not fully comprehend the celibacy of priests or religious, or even of lay Catholics who have chosen to vow not to marry. If good people fail to understand this, it is because God has not given them the gift, which he gives to relatively few. The celibate's motive is this: marriage and child-bearing are a divine pleasure and privilege; but they are very temporary. As Jesus says in today's gospel, marriage and begetting belong to this world, not the next. So those gifted with celibate chastity say to the rest of us: Marry if you will, and God prosper you! I, with God's help, will hold off, in anticipation of heaven.\n\nCelibate priests, sisters, brothers and vowed lay persons, whether they realize it or not, thus become constant signs to the rest of mankind. By their self-denial they remind us that there is a heaven awaiting the \"sons of God.\" In that heaven even the greatest joys of earthly married love will be seen to have been only like the light of a flickering candle in the brightness of the noonday sun.\n\n\\-Fr. Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q292: Why is it necessary to speak of the \"resurrection of the body\" as an Article of Faith?**\n\nThis article of our Catholic Creed was originally designed to counter the false teachings of Greek philosophers on the subject. The Greek pagan thinkers just may have been influenced by oriental philosophies such as Buddhism, which found one outlet in Gnosticism - holding a \"dualistic\" view that contrasted the importance of body versus soul. The conclusion of these pagans was that only the spirit or \"soul\" counted; \"body\" was not important.\n\nIn the monotheistic world of Israel, only the Sadducees (conservative priestly aristocracy) did not believe in the resurrection of the body, since they could find no compelling evidence of that in the Torah (Hebrew scriptures). The Pharisees, however, did believe based on the full Septuagint (Greek scriptures), such as Daniel 12:2. Jesus is clear that the laws of this world no longer hold after the resurrection from the dead. In addition, his answer affirms a bodily resurrection, and affirms that a whole person, with all its natural faculties, is raised to an other-worldly existence. Bodily happiness belongs to complete happiness for an Israelite. Hence the promise of God to the patriarchs (Gen 15:1ff) cannot be fulfilled by a life that ends with death. Jesus' answer is a consequence of God's faithfulness to his covenant, and affirms the dignity of humankind in its fullness.\n\nIn terms of the New Testament, it seems to me that the belief in the general resurrection perhaps finds its best expression in John 5, especially 5:25 and 5:28. Belief or disbelief in Jesus is the factor through which we decide on our future destiny right now.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** One resource you could review is \"The Creed in the Gospels\" by Fr. Alfons Kemmer (Paulist Press) which tracks the arguments above. Our Catechism of the Catholic Church adheres faithfully to the teaching of Jesus, to St. Paul, and to the Ecumenical Councils, that \"resurrection of the body\" means the soul will live on after death, and our 'mortal bodies' will come to life again (CCC #990). If there is no resurrection, our faith is in vain (CCC #991).\n\n---\n\n**Q605: There has to be a deeper issue involved in today’s Gospel than a discussion of multiple spouses in heaven!**\n\nIf there ever was a political or religious hidden agenda, it is surely manifested in our Gospel today (Luke 20:27-38). The Sadducees pose a question to Jesus involving the laws governing inheritance rights and levirate laws. However, the main theme is not about inheritances left to one’s posterity. Rather, it is the Sadducees’ attempt to trap Jesus with an absurd situation. They did not believe in the resurrection because they could not find anything about it in the Torah. Therefore, they thought they had Jesus in a no-win situation and could prevail in any argument about the resurrection. Needless to say, Jesus knew the Torah better than they did, and pointed them to the relevant passages about life after death.\n\nFor a Christian disciple, today’s First Reading (2 Macc 7:1-2, 9-14) and Gospel combine to speak about our belief in Jesus and belief in his teachings—especially his teachings which lead to our hope in the resurrection of our own bodies. If we hold fast in faith to the teachings of Christ and his Church, we can face any adversity—even to the extent of paying the ultimate price for our beliefs like the Maccabees family.\n\nNow, it may be hard to connect our lives to the situations of the Sadducees and the Maccabees. But think about this: it is simply about living our discipleship by clinging faithfully to the foundational principles that Jesus taught us. Those include the holiness of the sacred marriage bond between a man and a woman; the sanctity of all life from womb to tomb; justice for those we call marginalized and poor; and honesty in the political and economic world. Look around: those things are invisible today in the sick public segment of our culture! So you will be held up to public ridicule if you object to abortion; object to so-called gay marriages; object to destructive competition; and object to lying and deceptive politicians.\n\nIt is our trust in Jesus and hope in the resurrection that enables us to defend our principles in the public forum, no matter what the cost. Read and heed the signs of our times!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** By St. Augustine’s time, Christian faith had met with more opposition on the subject of our bodily resurrection than on any other topic (CCC 996). Just how this resurrection will happen is beyond our imagination and understanding (CCC 1000).\n\n---\n\n**What Shall We Be?**\n\nThe seven brothers in the Book of Maccabees gained strength to face martyrdom from their belief in the resurrection of the just. God had created them and sustained them; would he let their fidelity and suffering go for nothing? No! But their view of resurrection seems to be that it will be very much like this life -- more of the same.\n\nThe Gospel story clarifies the nature of the resurrected life. The Sadducees rejected the idea of resurrection of the body because they could find no reference to it in the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament, the only Scripture they accepted. They used their Torah law on widow's marriages to make the idea of the resurrection look silly. It would be intolerable for the for the seven brothers to have one wife in the resurrection, so there can be no resurrection.\n\nJesus responds with the Torah's reference to God speaking to Moses as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For the Jews God is not just the one they prayed to, but the God who calls them and saves them. If Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are simply dead, then their god isn't much of a savior. A God only of the dead is no god at all. This is Jesus' implicit argument. More important for us is his teaching that the resurrected life of the body is not material but a transformed life. Jesus doesn't say what this transformed life will be like, nor do other biblical books. The first epistle of St. John (3: 1-3), for instance, says \"We are God's children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed \"we will be like him for we will see him as he is.\" St. Paul uses the experience of a seed being transformed in to a plant and its blossom as an image of the transformation of the material body in to a spiritual body.",

Officiating at the graveside was the Reverend Ray Hewett, pastor of Hope Road Church of God in nearby Dunwoody. Reverend Mr. Hewett, expressing his reflections to the fifty relatives and friends of Liza who were there, reminded them of the unpredictability of death. &quot;We never know,&quot; he said, &quot;who is going next!&quot;</p>\n<p>Minutes afterwards, while the little crowd was leaving the grave, a bolt of lightning shot forth from a menacing cloud and killed Liza&apos;s grandson, Donald Metcalf. It also knocked his wife, Martha, senseless and burned their five-year-old son. Finally, it picked up the installer of the vault, James Cherry, and tossed him six feet into the air. &quot;Like a balloon.&quot; Cherry told the Associated Press representative the following day. &quot;It was like - bang!&quot; recalled the Reverend Hewett. &quot;I never witnessed anything like that in my 20 years of preaching!&quot;</p>\n<p>St. Matthew&apos;s gospel quotes our Lord as saying &quot;As the lightning from the east flashes to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.&quot; Today&apos;s passage from the gospel of Mark records the same warnings about the sudden frightening signs that are to precede Christ&apos;s final coming to judge the living and the dead. Again and again Jesus cautions us to be ready to give an account to Him in the presence of all His creatures, of how we have used His grace.</p>\n<p>The universal judgment has been long in coming, and may be delayed a good deal longer.

But it was Donald Metcalf&apos;s time.&quot;</p>\n<p>On this last Sunday of the church year, therefore, the liturgy warns us to be ready at all seasons for the coming of our Judge.

McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q241: What does the &quot;fig tree&quot; in today&apos;s gospel (Mk 13:24-32) have to do with the End of Time?</strong></p>\n<p>Jesus was an expert at taking ordinary, everyday things from our lived experiences (or rather, those of the people of his own time) and drawing a simple lesson from them for the people. The fig tree is no exception, since it was (and is) a very common tree in Israel.

Of course not. All apocalyptic literature or language is meant to bring hope to the true believer.

On the other hand, apocalyptic language is at the same time a reminder that we need to be prepared, to expect Jesus to return at any moment.

    "markdown": "**Be Watchful, Pray Constantly**\n\nIn July, 1982, 91 year-old Liza Poteete was laid to rest in the cemetery at Blairsville, Georgia. Officiating at the graveside was the Reverend Ray Hewett, pastor of Hope Road Church of God in nearby Dunwoody. Reverend Mr. Hewett, expressing his reflections to the fifty relatives and friends of Liza who were there, reminded them of the unpredictability of death. \"We never know,\" he said, \"who is going next!\"\n\nMinutes afterwards, while the little crowd was leaving the grave, a bolt of lightning shot forth from a menacing cloud and killed Liza's grandson, Donald Metcalf. It also knocked his wife, Martha, senseless and burned their five-year-old son. Finally, it picked up the installer of the vault, James Cherry, and tossed him six feet into the air. \"Like a balloon.\" Cherry told the Associated Press representative the following day. \"It was like - bang!\" recalled the Reverend Hewett. \"I never witnessed anything like that in my 20 years of preaching!\"\n\nSt. Matthew's gospel quotes our Lord as saying \"As the lightning from the east flashes to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.\" Today's passage from the gospel of Mark records the same warnings about the sudden frightening signs that are to precede Christ's final coming to judge the living and the dead. Again and again Jesus cautions us to be ready to give an account to Him in the presence of all His creatures, of how we have used His grace.\n\nThe universal judgment has been long in coming, and may be delayed a good deal longer. But we must also be ready always for a sudden personal summons. James Cherry, Blairsville, preserved from death said, \"I know there's a God up above looking after us, and it just wasn't my time!! But it was Donald Metcalf's time.\"\n\nOn this last Sunday of the church year, therefore, the liturgy warns us to be ready at all seasons for the coming of our Judge. As the Alleluia verse says: \"Be watchful, pray constantly that you may be worthy to stand before the Son of Man.\"\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q241: What does the \"fig tree\" in today's gospel (Mk 13:24-32) have to do with the End of Time?**\n\nJesus was an expert at taking ordinary, everyday things from our lived experiences (or rather, those of the people of his own time) and drawing a simple lesson from them for the people. The fig tree is no exception, since it was (and is) a very common tree in Israel. Like our cherry tree in America, the blossoms of the fig tree in the Middle East are a \"sign\" of the arrival of Spring.\n\nAnd reading the \"signs\" gives us the solution to the question. When the blossoms appear on a fig tree, you know what it means; it means that springtime has arrived. In the same way, Jesus says, learn to understand what the \"signs in the heavens\" mean - - they are a warning that you need to be prepared!\n\nIs this a \"fearsome\" thing? Of course not. All apocalyptic literature or language is meant to bring hope to the true believer.

What state of affairs will our faith and our soul be in at that unforeseen moment? Don't take a chance - - be ready; be hopeful; be confident, no matter what kind of suffering or persecution you may be experiencing.\n\nLive according to God's law of love. Then you will find that your name has indeed been written in \"the book\" (First Reading: Dan 12:1-3). There is absolutely nothing to fear.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The \"end times\" is not a new concept; it began with the Incarnation (CCC #686). We do not know the date of the end of the earth or humankind (CCC #1048), but we do know that it will be a mysterious, transforming renewal of both humanity and the world (CCC #1043-46). Do you have a holy fear of God, and a blessed hope of the Lord's return (CCC #1041)? What actions do you think you could take to express and live your faith in this reality?\n\n---\n\n**Q398: This gospel is scary stuff (Mark 13:24-32).

That is the trial to which all human beings will be subjected when Christ comes to judge the living and the dead.</p>\n<p>Even before that judicial trial, however, we must all suffer many trials, Our Lord himself has warned us. Not only the anguish of natural griefs and disasters, but even the efforts of evil men to win us away from Christ because they hate His name and all that it represents. So even you and I might be called to martyrdom. &quot;Some of you will be put to death,&quot; Jesus says in today&apos;s gospel. But even in the midst of such persecution, we must not fear. He will stand unseen by our side.</p>\n<p>He stood by the side of Captain John P. Flynn, U.S.M.C. in 1954. When we think of martyrs, we usually think of people long ago and far away. Captain Flynn was a very modern and very American &quot;martyr&quot; during the Korean conflict. A news dispatch of the National Catholic News Service reported the stirring tale of this Catholic Officer whose airplane was downed behind the North Korea Communist Lines.</p>\n<p>Flynn survived the crash of his plane but was captured and marched off to a Communist prison camp. En route, his captors made him face a drum-head trial in a small Korean village. They discovered from his rosary that he was a Catholic. The court ordered him to throw this rosary on the ground, trample on it and spit upon it. This would have meant, as his captors knew, his rejection of the Catholic faith; for the rosary is both symbol and summary of Christian belief.</p>\n<p>John Flynn refused. They next brought out a block of wood and an axe, and made him kneel and put his neck upon the block. They raised the axe. In that brief moment, he said later on, &quot;I thought of my family and how they needed me. But I knew if I gave in to the Reds, I would be no good to my family or to myself and that I might lose my soul. This was it!&quot;</p>\n<p>The threat of beheading proved to be only a trick. What the court really wanted was to have Flynn &quot;confess&quot; that he had carried on germ warfare. Far from &quot;confessing&quot;, he talked back, ridiculed their propaganda, and when put into prison plotted escapes, and led prayer services for his fellow captives, using with gratitude the rosary he had refused to desecrate. After 16 months, he was finally freed. On his return to headquarters, he was awarded the Navy and Marine Cross for valor.</p>\n<p>But John Flynn already had a greater reward than any decoration. It was the remembrance that when he had been brought to trial for Christ&apos;s name, he had offered his life totally to God. If Jesus had withheld the axe, he had not withheld the martyr&apos;s crown.</p>\n<p>-Fr. Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q293: St. Paul says just after today&apos;s reading (2 Thess 3:7-12) that we are to &quot;warn&quot; and &quot;ostracize&quot; those who are disorderly (v. 7,11), not as an enemy but as a brother. What was it that he considered to be &quot;disorderly&quot;?</strong></p>\n<p>Bible scholars can only suggest possibilities, based on the limited clues that Paul gives in this situation. The basic concern seems to be that the &quot;disorderly&quot; are interfering with the daily &quot;stability&quot; of others in the believing community.</p>\n<p>Since stability comes only through a lived faith -- characterized by mutual sharing of God-given gifts and the self-giving that flows willingly from true Discipleship -- it seems clear that some people are disturbing the lived faith of others. Paul does indicate that there is an element that is so concerned about the imminent Second Coming of Christ that they have disregarded their responsibility to contribute to their own support, and may even be spreading false rumors and false prophecies about the parousia. So they are distracting the rest of the community with their gossip and idleness, neglecting their need to be self-giving.</p>\n<p>When the Lord comes, he will want to find us actively using the gifts he gave to us to build up the community, living out our faith in self-sacrifice, rather than cowering in a prayer corner fearful of what the future might bring. &quot;Being&quot; church - the people of God - consists of &quot;communion&quot; (gathering, listening, sharing) and &quot;mission&quot; (living our faith, proclaiming the good news, and inviting others into this same communion).</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>God does not invite us to idleness, but wants us to trust in his providence (CCC #2830). Hand in hand with that blessing goes the responsibility to recognize the needs of our brothers and sisters in the human family, and contribute to their well being (CCC #2831). The last judgment will give an accounting of our response (CCC #1038).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q450: This is a &#x201C;scary&#x201D; gospel [Luke 21:5-19].

But to focus on the &#x201C;bad news&#x201D; would be to miss the &#x201C;Good News.&#x201D; Did you hear what Jesus promised for you? He promised you would be hated and persecuted because of your faith; he promised you would have to defend your faith in court; and he promised that your friends and relatives would turn against you because of your faith.

If you truly believe in Jesus and live out his teachings, then you will be in conflict with the structures and people around you.</p>\n<p>Note carefully: these things that Jesus promised are happening in our country today, just like they happened in Jesus&#x2019; generation! Here are some examples. If you hate the heinous crime of abortion, that puts you at odds with the immoral interpretation of bad laws by our courts. If you defend &#x201C;life&#x201D; issues in any forum, you will be labeled a fool or idiot (probably behind your back) by the misguided pro-choice people. If you object to the pagan approach our government takes regarding the education of your children on moral issues, then you will be persecuted. These are realities! Persecution takes many forms.</p>\n<p>But Jesus also promises to give you wisdom in all of those situations. In other words, he will arm you with the truth. No matter what happens, even death, if you cling to the truth &#x2013; as passed on to us through our bishops united with the Holy Father, then you have the best gift of all: the very wisdom of Jesus! Knowing you have Jesus on your side, and willing to die proclaiming his truth, gives one the hope that one needs in any unpleasant situation. That is Good News!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Our &#x201C;patient endurance&#x201D; in clinging to our faith in Jesus will gain us eternal life, but we can lose our faith if we do not wage spiritual warfare (CCC #162).

Some will hear with a morbid interest in calamity and try to figure out just when all this will come about. But the Scriptures present the End-Time as a time of fulfillment as well as a time of retribution. Malachi uses the image of the sun to describe the Day of the Lord. The light of the sun can burn and destroy but it also gives the light and warmth necessary for life. We depend on it&apos;s warmth and light but overexposure can cause blindness or cancer. The choice is ours to use or abuse. So too our experience of the Last Days will depend on the human choices we made in response to the Lord&apos;s call.</p>\n<p>Some of the Thessalonian Christians, convinced that the second coming was just around the corner, had given up working. This is wrong, says St. Paul; we must continue living our lives and doing our work for the glory of the Lord, working at the tasks he has set for us. Let that day come in the Lord&apos;s own good time.

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>Like a bride bedecked</strong></p>\n<p>When Lady Diana Spencer was preparing for her wedding to the Prince of Wales, every effort was made by designers David and Elizabeth Emanuel, and, in fact, by all the planners of the wedding, to prevent the design of the bride&apos;s dress from being revealed before the ceremony on July 29, 1981. Of course, the other dressmakers of Britain did their best to learn the secret in advance. The sooner they could start making copies, the quicker they could sell them to other prospective brides who would want to be married in gowns &quot;just like Lady Di&apos;s.&quot; Fortunately, the secret was perfectly kept. Only at 5:30 AM on the wedding day did Buckingham Palace release to the news media a sketch of the wedding dress.</p>\n<p>Probably the real purpose behind our custom of not letting a groom see his bride in her wedding dress before they reach the church, is that he may behold his chosen one in that moment at the absolute peak of her beauty.</p>\n<p>How pleased Charles must have been when he saw his bride, her natural handsomeness enhanced by this rich and dazzling garment. Perhaps he even thought of the familiar words of the psalm, &quot;All glorious is the king&apos;s daughter as she enters; her raiment is threaded with spun gold&quot; (45:54).</p>\n<p>But the Church has always seen the festal dress of a bride and groom as something more than device to please the eyes of the marrying couple. It is rather a symbol of the beauty of the souls of those who take each other in marriage. Or, if these souls are perhaps not yet perfect, their garb should at least remind them, &quot;As you have clothed your bodies in loveliness, now clothe your souls in grace.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;... He has clothed me with a robe of salvation ... like a bridegroom adorned with a diadem, like a bride bedecked with her jewels.&quot; (Isaiah, 61:10-11.) Today&apos;s first reading.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q349: Both Isaiah and Jesus felt the &#x201C;spirit of the Lord God&#x201D; upon them. Yet centuries have passed without solving the problem of injustice. Is the passage (First Reading) relevant today?</strong></p>\n<p>A friend (Rev. Mickey Anders) once pointed me to a website that asks for your solutions or opinions on &#x201C;how to fix the world.&#x201D; They have some interesting remedies, ranging all over the spectrum - - from &#x201C;how to prevent tailgating&#x201D; to &#x201C;how to solve world hunger.&#x201D; Like most inventions or pregnant ideas, there is usually something missing; but what is not omitted is the problem that led to the quest for a solution.</p>\n<p>In our First Reading today (Is 61:1-2, 10-11) the &#x201C;problem&#x201D; is clearly stated. Far too many people are poor and brokenhearted, and many are prisoners (both spiritually and physically). Social injustice and lack of brotherly love are at the root of the problem, caused and aggravated by an unfaithfulness to God&#x2019;s expressed will for his people. This problem seems to appear in every generation, because even Jesus tells us that we will always have the poor with us (Mt 26:11). But the &#x201C;solution&#x201D; is also clearly stated by Isaiah. Unlike the &#x201C;fix the world&#x201D; website suggestions, which are more like dreams without a chance of fulfillment, the Prophet Isaiah points to the &#x201C;core&#x201D; of the matter: justice and love.</p>\n<p>Our God is a God of mercy and love; he is also a God of justice. In His divine plan, justice and love go hand in hand and are almost synonymous. You see this clearly in the Commandments and Beatitudes, and in the &#x201C;last judgment&#x201D; scenes from scripture. You cannot have one without the other. And God calls us to be his disciples, the instruments of his love and justice.</p>\n<p>You will know that the &#x201C;spirit of the Lord is upon you&#x201D; when you treat everyone equally; when you speak out against social injustice; when you denounce cultural immorality; when you obey God&#x2019;s chosen representatives (the Catholic bishops); and when you engage regularly in the well-known trilogy of prayer-almsgiving-fasting.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Jesus Christ made this scripture above from Isaiah his inaugural address, proclaiming the Good News (CCC #714). It is because he embraced our death that he can now communicate his own Spirit of life to us (CCC #713). Isaiah (and Jesus) use the language of &#x201C;promise&#x201D; (CCC #715), and his mission becomes the mission of the Church &#x2013; you and me (CCC #730), his instruments for transforming the world.

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>Rejoice in the Lord always</strong></p>\n<p>Today&apos;s Mass has a constant refrain, &quot;Rejoice!&quot; Stop worrying, it tells us: the Saviour is coming. Rejoice!</p>\n<p>But rejoicing does not come easily to fetters like ourselves. When somebody urges us, &quot;Be of good cheer,&quot; we are liable to retort, &quot;What is there to be cheerful about?&quot; We can tick off a whole litany of miseries in proof: inflation, violence, political wrangles, family problems, physical ailments. When we have run out of other items, there is the weather. Sometimes we sigh seriously for the &quot;good old days&quot; before we were born. Everything seems to have been simpler then, and at least relatively perfect. A person could really rejoice, we say, in times like those.</p>\n<p>One day back in the fifth century, St. Augustine, the great bishop of Hippo, was preaching to a congregation of worry-warts like ourselves. He has heard them sighing, too, for the &quot;good old days.&quot; In this case it was the days of the Apostles four centuries back. Then, they said, everything had been rosy. Then, the glow of Christ&apos;s resurrection still tinted Christian life.</p>\n<p>Augustine took issue with their unrealistic nostalgia. &quot;You hear people complaining,&quot; he said, &quot;about this present day and age because things were much better in former times.&quot; &quot;I wonder,&quot; asked the Saint, &quot;what would happen if they could be taken back to the days of their ancestors - would we not still hear them complaining?&quot; You may think past ages were good, he concluded, but it is only because you are not living in them!</p>\n<p>True. We are not yet residing in heaven, but neither were our forebears. The &quot;good old days&quot; never existed. Our cause for joy is not the clouded present but a cloudless eternity. Even now, faith and hope in eternal life can bring us real joy, because they instill in our hearts &quot;God&apos;s own peace, which is beyond all understanding.&quot; (Philippians, 4. Today&apos;s second reading)</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>C245: John the Baptist seems to be giving a set of guidelines to follow, to prepare for Jesus&apos; coming (Lk 3:10-18). Is this a formula to gain God&apos;s favor when he comes?</strong></p>\n<p>There are two dangers to watch out for during Advent. One is to think we can &quot;earn&quot; God&apos;s favor by being &quot;a good little Catholic.&quot; Pelagius was a monk from the fifth century who thought and taught that we could be perfect, all by ourselves. We just had to have the will power and determination to live a good moral life. Of course, that heresy (Pelagianism) was destroyed by Augustine&apos;s arguments and eventually condemned by the Church, because at its root it challenged our need for redemption, for Christ, and even our need for a sacramental Church.

    "markdown": "**Rejoice in the Lord always**\n\nToday's Mass has a constant refrain, \"Rejoice!\" Stop worrying, it tells us: the Saviour is coming. Rejoice!\n\nBut rejoicing does not come easily to fetters like ourselves. When somebody urges us, \"Be of good cheer,\" we are liable to retort, \"What is there to be cheerful about?\" We can tick off a whole litany of miseries in proof: inflation, violence, political wrangles, family problems, physical ailments. When we have run out of other items, there is the weather. Sometimes we sigh seriously for the \"good old days\" before we were born. Everything seems to have been simpler then, and at least relatively perfect. A person could really rejoice, we say, in times like those.\n\nOne day back in the fifth century, St. Augustine, the great bishop of Hippo, was preaching to a congregation of worry-warts like ourselves. He has heard them sighing, too, for the \"good old days.\" In this case it was the days of the Apostles four centuries back. Then, they said, everything had been rosy. Then, the glow of Christ's resurrection still tinted Christian life.\n\nAugustine took issue with their unrealistic nostalgia. \"You hear people complaining,\" he said, \"about this present day and age because things were much better in former times.\" \"I wonder,\" asked the Saint, \"what would happen if they could be taken back to the days of their ancestors - would we not still hear them complaining?\" You may think past ages were good, he concluded, but it is only because you are not living in them!\n\nTrue. We are not yet residing in heaven, but neither were our forebears. The \"good old days\" never existed. Our cause for joy is not the clouded present but a cloudless eternity. Even now, faith and hope in eternal life can bring us real joy, because they instill in our hearts \"God's own peace, which is beyond all understanding.\" (Philippians, 4. Today's second reading)\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**C245: John the Baptist seems to be giving a set of guidelines to follow, to prepare for Jesus' coming (Lk 3:10-18). Is this a formula to gain God's favor when he comes?**\n\nThere are two dangers to watch out for during Advent. One is to think we can \"earn\" God's favor by being \"a good little Catholic.\" Pelagius was a monk from the fifth century who thought and taught that we could be perfect, all by ourselves. We just had to have the will power and determination to live a good moral life. Of course, that heresy (Pelagianism) was destroyed by Augustine's arguments and eventually condemned by the Church, because at its root it challenged our need for redemption, for Christ, and even our need for a sacramental Church. \\[This is also one of the many flaws in Buddhism, Islam, etc.\\] God's grace is freely offered, freely given; we cannot \"earn\" it or \"gain God's favor.\"\n\nThe second danger during Advent is \"memory loss.\" We need to avoid getting wrapped up in \"end time worries\" and apocalyptic fears which make us lose sight of a terribly important point during Advent. That important point is that Christ already dwells within us from our Baptism! By his life, death and resurrection he has cleared the way between us and God. He has already leveled those mountains and filled those valleys, making our journey back to God possible, and now we wait with joyful and hopeful expectancy for his second coming.\n\nAs we reach the midpoint of Advent, it is time for to check the \"travel weather.\" Is our Advent journey superficial, focused only on \"methods\" and external actions? Or have I made a deliberate effort to change my behavior and seek Jesus Christ at a \"deeper,\" interior level? Do I recognize that I need his grace every moment of my life? Is my effort to grow closer to Jesus this Advent coming from a sense of love or a sense of fear? Have I even made a real effort in the first place? It is not too late to start.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** God never forces himself on anyone.

The band from Bishop Kearney High School in Rochester accepted in 1982. It was the eighth parade trip to Dublin for the &quot;Marching Kings,&quot; and they had won the major Irish awards in 1979. But a win in 1979 did not guarantee a win in 1982. In three years the band membership had changed almost completely, and they were in competition against over eighty international quick-stepping units.</p>\n<p>Flying to Ireland a bit early, the Kings marched in some smaller parades. At Galway their concert and jazz bands carried off first honors. Judges of the Limerick parade voted them the top school band. These awards were encouraging but second-class. Band Director Ray Shahin would not let his team relax. At Dublin, he warned them he would simply not let them beat themselves.</p>\n<p>Well, the big parade took place on March 17 on Dublin&apos;s O&apos;Connell Street. Traditional Irish rain mixed with hail didn&apos;t make the high stepping any easier. The Marching Kings did their best, but the prize winners were not to be announced until evening. They all went to an official dancing party tired and tense. Finally at 8 PM Mr. Shahin came in with the verdict. Color Guard and Twirlers category, first place: Bishop Kearney. Best overseas band category: Bishop Kearney. And finally over-all best band category: Bishop Kearney. Pandemonium broke loose. The 140 winners sprang to life again, cheering, hugging, weeping. Two days later their schoolmates welcomed them back to Rochester with a banner inscribed &quot;We&apos;re walking proud!&quot;</p>\n<p>God permits us all occasional moments of unexpected delight. &quot;Pinch me,&quot; we say, &quot;I think I&apos;m dreaming.&quot; Thrills like these can help us to appreciate the far greater joy of the disciples at Easter.

Why such a continued focus on that subject?</strong></p>\n<p>Jesus was acutely aware that the Evil One would try to &quot;steal&quot; souls from God and destroy life. This is why Jesus says that he, Jesus, came to bring new life to his sheep and to have that new life more abundantly (e.g., Jn 10:10).</p>\n<p>But there is a barrier to this new life, and that is the personal and community sinfulness that we place between ourselves and God. Peter and the apostles were well aware of this barrier, and thus we hear Peter in today&apos;s first reading (Acts 3:13-15, 17-19) calling for repentance and a change in the direction of our lives, to remove this barrier of sin.</p>\n<p>It is crucial to realize that we need to deal with this sin before new life can come into our hearts. Unfortunately, our first reading today stops in mid sentence. Listen to the full sentence: &quot;Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord&#x2026;&quot; (v. 19, RSV). That refreshing new life is there, ready and waiting to be delivered by the Author of Life to all who accept it through repentance and by amending lifestyles.</p>\n<p>Finally, it you think St. Luke (and all the other evangelists) &quot;harp&quot; on the subject of repentance, it is well to remember that the very first words out of Jesus&apos; mouth in his public ministry were about the urgent need for repentance (Mk 1:15). One wishes that we would hear more of this call to action from our modern day preachers!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> To believe in Jesus and his call to repentance first requires a death to selfishness, that obstinate barrier between us and God (CCC #591).

Jesus also puts that thought to rest, by eating in their presence &#x2013; ghosts don&#x2019;t eat; they don&#x2019;t have physical bodies that can consume food.

St. John Vianney, the famous Cur&#xE9; of Ars of nineteenth century France, often received this gift as he worked with souls.</p>\n<p>For instance, years after the Saint&apos;s death, a certain railway worker testified before a church court how he had been converted by him. The fame of the Cur&#xE9; had prompted him to visit Ars, not to go to confession, but just to see what this priest was like. He liked what he saw, and followed St. John into the sacristy. The Saint at once told him to kneel down in the confessional. Willy-nilly he knelt.</p>\n<p>&quot;How long is it since your last confession?&quot; the Cur&#xE9; asked him. &quot;Such a long time that I can&apos;t remember,&quot; the stranger replied. &quot;Examine yourself well. It is twenty-eight years.&quot; &quot;Twenty-eight years? Yes, that&apos;s right.&quot; &quot;And you did not receive Holy Communion then,&quot; the Saint continued: &quot;you only received absolution.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s correct, too.&quot; As they talked, the railroad man felt his faith growing stronger. In the end, he made a complete and heartfelt confession. And he stuck by his new resolution.</p>\n<p>When Jesus came up to Jerusalem and cleansed the Temple of its hucksters, many of the Judeans hailed his teaching. However, he did not trust them or take them into his confidence. He knew they were looking for a political Messiah, not the suffering Messiah he was called to be. He could read in their minds the point of view that would eventually turn them against Him.</p>\n<p>... He was well aware of what was in man&apos;s heart. (John, 2:25. Today&apos;s gospel).</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>B207: We already have the Ten Commandments to guide us, part of our Judeo-Christian heritage. Does Jesus&apos; teaching really add anything to those, or just fulfill what is already there?</strong></p>\n<p>Both! Yes, Jesus did indeed add to the Commandments, but what he added was an &quot;enhancement&quot; or enlargement of those revelations of God&apos;s will. For example, he taught us to love the one God as &quot;Father,&quot; and he taught us about the triune God (Father, Son, Spirit/Advocate) which are certainly beautiful enhancements to help us understand the First Commandment better. The commandments dealing with respect for life are not limited just to adultery (Sixth) or killing (Fifth); in fact, those two were never limited in the first place. But Jesus helps us understand more profoundly that sexuality (Sixth) now seeks the internal chastity of thoughts and desires , and that injurious behavior (Fifth, Seventh, Eighth etc) now seeks internal charity and active love of neighbor in word and deed (e.g., Matt 5:17-48).</p>\n<p>Israel was what we might describe as a primitive culture at the time they received these commandments through Moses. Therefore, they had to be very general principles, so that they could be easily understood. The teachings of Jesus are a very rich expansion upon this framework of moral conduct. More commonly we call this expansion of Jesus on moral conduct &quot;The Beatitudes&quot; (as reflected, for example, in Chapter 5 of the gospel according to Matthew). If &quot;happiness&quot; with God is our ultimate goal in life, as taught by St. Thomas Aquinas, then the Beatitudes - an expansion on the 10 Commandments - is the road map presented by Jesus as the way to that goal.</p>\n<p>Who can reach such a difficult goal?

St. John Vianney, the famous Curé of Ars of nineteenth century France, often received this gift as he worked with souls.\n\nFor instance, years after the Saint's death, a certain railway worker testified before a church court how he had been converted by him. The fame of the Curé had prompted him to visit Ars, not to go to confession, but just to see what this priest was like. He liked what he saw, and followed St. John into the sacristy. The Saint at once told him to kneel down in the confessional. Willy-nilly he knelt.\n\n\"How long is it since your last confession?\" the Curé asked him. \"Such a long time that I can't remember,\" the stranger replied. \"Examine yourself well. It is twenty-eight years.\" \"Twenty-eight years? Yes, that's right.\" \"And you did not receive Holy Communion then,\" the Saint continued: \"you only received absolution.\" \"That's correct, too.\" As they talked, the railroad man felt his faith growing stronger. In the end, he made a complete and heartfelt confession. And he stuck by his new resolution.\n\nWhen Jesus came up to Jerusalem and cleansed the Temple of its hucksters, many of the Judeans hailed his teaching. However, he did not trust them or take them into his confidence. He knew they were looking for a political Messiah, not the suffering Messiah he was called to be. He could read in their minds the point of view that would eventually turn them against Him.\n\n... He was well aware of what was in man's heart. (John, 2:25. Today's gospel).\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**B207: We already have the Ten Commandments to guide us, part of our Judeo-Christian heritage. Does Jesus' teaching really add anything to those, or just fulfill what is already there?**\n\nBoth! Yes, Jesus did indeed add to the Commandments, but what he added was an \"enhancement\" or enlargement of those revelations of God's will. For example, he taught us to love the one God as \"Father,\" and he taught us about the triune God (Father, Son, Spirit/Advocate) which are certainly beautiful enhancements to help us understand the First Commandment better. The commandments dealing with respect for life are not limited just to adultery (Sixth) or killing (Fifth); in fact, those two were never limited in the first place. But Jesus helps us understand more profoundly that sexuality (Sixth) now seeks the internal chastity of thoughts and desires , and that injurious behavior (Fifth, Seventh, Eighth etc) now seeks internal charity and active love of neighbor in word and deed (e.g., Matt 5:17-48).\n\nIsrael was what we might describe as a primitive culture at the time they received these commandments through Moses. Therefore, they had to be very general principles, so that they could be easily understood. The teachings of Jesus are a very rich expansion upon this framework of moral conduct. More commonly we call this expansion of Jesus on moral conduct \"The Beatitudes\" (as reflected, for example, in Chapter 5 of the gospel according to Matthew). If \"happiness\" with God is our ultimate goal in life, as taught by St. Thomas Aquinas, then the Beatitudes - an expansion on the 10 Commandments - is the road map presented by Jesus as the way to that goal.\n\nWho can reach such a difficult goal? Jesus! And you! That is why we say that Jesus is the fulfillment of the law; he shows that it can be done, if we focus on love of God and neighbor. Everything is possible through love, and it is the love of Jesus that strengthens us through the Sacraments to help us on our way to that goal.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The \"10 Commandments\" are not a burden, but an incredible gift, because they reveal God to us and his holy will for us (CCC #2058-60). These commandments are certainly also discernible by reason alone, because the natural law was imprinted on our hearts at our conception, and it finds its expression in the commandments (CCC# 1955, 2070-71).

Has our \"worship space\" lost its \"natural habitat\" that is conducive to meaningful worship? Would a re-centralization of the Holy Tabernacle help restore an aura of holiness that characterized our church space for so long? Has \"too much art\" become a distraction, where even \"The\" sign of our Christianity (i.e., the Crucifix) has many times disappeared? Or, is church art a helpful aid to proper worship?

Unfortunately we, and all human beings, are prone to quarreling. In some tragic cases, throughout the history of the church, Catholics have not only quarreled, but let their quarrels end up in schism. Schism means withdrawal from, and denial of the authority Christ gave to his church and its shepherds.</p>\n<p>Some schisms have been large and have remained unhealed even after centuries. Others have been small, sometimes, permanent, sometimes (thank God) brief. All have involved unchristian bitterness.</p>\n<p>In the 1850&apos;s there was a small schism in a parish in Rochester, New York. It serves as a good illustration. The issue debated was control by the laity of church funds and of pastoral appointments.</p>\n<p>From as early as 1785, people in some American Catholic parishes had been embattled with Catholic church authorities over these matters of control. One cause of the trouble was that the state laws for parish incorporation were designed for Protestant parishes, in which, unlike Catholic parishes, laymen were allowed to manage funds and hire or fire pastors. Wherever Catholic laypeople interpreted the State law in a Catholic way, a &quot;trustee&quot; corporation could work out. The trouble was that lay Catholic trustees so often abused their powers - even violently - that the American bishops had to forbid this type of lay participation entirely. Gradually, from 1829 to 1850, the bishops were able to put an end to most of these factional quarrels.</p>\n<p>But not to all. In the 1850&apos;s, in a handful of American Catholic parishes, &quot;trusteeists&quot; decided to make a last stand. One was the German Catholic parish of St. Peter&apos;s Rochester. Here the ringleaders were so bitter that they even worked hand-in-glove with the Know-nothings (an anti-Catholic political party) to get a state law passed demanding that Catholic parishes incorporate according to the Protestant form. When the bishop (John Timon of Buffalo) suspended church services at St. Peter&apos;s as a countermove, they replied by incorporating a new parish called &quot;The Christ Catholic St. Stephen&apos;s Congregation.&quot; This was schism. Even though they used the adjective &quot;Catholic,&quot; they were no longer a part of the Catholic Church, and no Catholic could attend worship there in good conscience.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the dissidents came to their senses eventually. By 1862 Bishop Timon had received all but one back into the Catholic fold. The Catholic parish was reincorporated under the name &quot;Ss. Peter and Paul,&quot; and as such it still functions.</p>\n<p>Even today, however, Catholics can be tempted to schism. Factions still arise and some Catholics even leave the Church to worship at other churches that may call themselves &quot;Catholic&quot; but are not in union with either the local Catholic bishop or through him, with the pope. Schism has often been called &quot;tearing apart of the seamless robe of Christ&quot; - that is, splitting the people of God into parts. Christ prayed &quot;that all may be one.&quot; Those who foster disunion are therefore enemies of Christ&apos;s prayer.</p>\n<p>-Fr. Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q303: Is the gospel today (Mt 4:12-23) showing us how easy it is to become a good Disciple?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes and no. Today we hear of Jesus&#x2019; invitation to Peter, Andrew, James and John to &#x201C;follow him,&#x201D; to jump into his own net. And immediately they drop their own nets, leave their jobs and careers, and follow Jesus.</p>\n<p>I wish it were that easy! The &#x2018;immediate&#x2019; response to Jesus&#x2019; invitation to each one of us is, of course, an immediate, hearty &#x201C;yes&#x201D; &#x2013; or at least so it ought to be. But there is much more to Discipleship than simply jumping into the net of Jesus. After spending time with Jesus, becoming one with Him, we now need to leave the &#x2018;net&#x2019; and become the attracting light of Christ for others. Everyone calls everyone else to repentance, both by word and deed.</p>\n<p>We each have different gifts, and all are gifts received from the &#x2018;throne of grace&#x2019; (as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews says). But we are all given one mission: to spread the good news of salvation in and through Jesus Christ. Everything we say or do needs to point to the saving Cross of Jesus, in one loving way or another. St. Paul reminds us of our different gifts, when he says that even he, also an apostle, was not sent to baptize, but to preach (Second Reading, 1 Cor 1:10,13-17). Have you taken time to consider your own gifts, and how Jesus wants you to use them?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!&#xA0; </strong>Do not neglect the first step into the net of Jesus, the step of &#x201C;repentance&#x201D; - which is also the first teaching of Jesus (CCC#1989). The Church responds to Jesus by reminding us that the call from Jesus is &#x201C;personal&#x201D; for each one of us.

    "markdown": "**Let There Be No Factions**\n\nIn today's second reading, St. Paul warns the Corinthians - and all Christians - against factions: \"Be united in mind and judgment.\" It should be unnecessary to tell those joined by baptism into Christ's mystical body to avoid fighting each other! Unfortunately we, and all human beings, are prone to quarreling. In some tragic cases, throughout the history of the church, Catholics have not only quarreled, but let their quarrels end up in schism. Schism means withdrawal from, and denial of the authority Christ gave to his church and its shepherds.\n\nSome schisms have been large and have remained unhealed even after centuries. Others have been small, sometimes, permanent, sometimes (thank God) brief. All have involved unchristian bitterness.\n\nIn the 1850's there was a small schism in a parish in Rochester, New York. It serves as a good illustration. The issue debated was control by the laity of church funds and of pastoral appointments.\n\nFrom as early as 1785, people in some American Catholic parishes had been embattled with Catholic church authorities over these matters of control. One cause of the trouble was that the state laws for parish incorporation were designed for Protestant parishes, in which, unlike Catholic parishes, laymen were allowed to manage funds and hire or fire pastors. Wherever Catholic laypeople interpreted the State law in a Catholic way, a \"trustee\" corporation could work out. The trouble was that lay Catholic trustees so often abused their powers - even violently - that the American bishops had to forbid this type of lay participation entirely. Gradually, from 1829 to 1850, the bishops were able to put an end to most of these factional quarrels.\n\nBut not to all. In the 1850's, in a handful of American Catholic parishes, \"trusteeists\" decided to make a last stand. One was the German Catholic parish of St. Peter's Rochester. Here the ringleaders were so bitter that they even worked hand-in-glove with the Know-nothings (an anti-Catholic political party) to get a state law passed demanding that Catholic parishes incorporate according to the Protestant form. When the bishop (John Timon of Buffalo) suspended church services at St. Peter's as a countermove, they replied by incorporating a new parish called \"The Christ Catholic St. Stephen's Congregation.\" This was schism. Even though they used the adjective \"Catholic,\" they were no longer a part of the Catholic Church, and no Catholic could attend worship there in good conscience.\n\nFortunately, the dissidents came to their senses eventually. By 1862 Bishop Timon had received all but one back into the Catholic fold. The Catholic parish was reincorporated under the name \"Ss. Peter and Paul,\" and as such it still functions.\n\nEven today, however, Catholics can be tempted to schism. Factions still arise and some Catholics even leave the Church to worship at other churches that may call themselves \"Catholic\" but are not in union with either the local Catholic bishop or through him, with the pope. Schism has often been called \"tearing apart of the seamless robe of Christ\" - that is, splitting the people of God into parts. Christ prayed \"that all may be one.\" Those who foster disunion are therefore enemies of Christ's prayer.\n\n\\-Fr. Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q303: Is the gospel today (Mt 4:12-23) showing us how easy it is to become a good Disciple?**\n\nYes and no. Today we hear of Jesus’ invitation to Peter, Andrew, James and John to “follow him,” to jump into his own net. And immediately they drop their own nets, leave their jobs and careers, and follow Jesus.\n\nI wish it were that easy! The ‘immediate’ response to Jesus’ invitation to each one of us is, of course, an immediate, hearty “yes” – or at least so it ought to be. But there is much more to Discipleship than simply jumping into the net of Jesus. After spending time with Jesus, becoming one with Him, we now need to leave the ‘net’ and become the attracting light of Christ for others. Everyone calls everyone else to repentance, both by word and deed.\n\nWe each have different gifts, and all are gifts received from the ‘throne of grace’ (as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews says). But we are all given one mission: to spread the good news of salvation in and through Jesus Christ. Everything we say or do needs to point to the saving Cross of Jesus, in one loving way or another. St. Paul reminds us of our different gifts, when he says that even he, also an apostle, was not sent to baptize, but to preach (Second Reading, 1 Cor 1:10,13-17). Have you taken time to consider your own gifts, and how Jesus wants you to use them?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Do not neglect the first step into the net of Jesus, the step of “repentance” - which is also the first teaching of Jesus (CCC#1989). The Church responds to Jesus by reminding us that the call from Jesus is “personal” for each one of us. It is then our responsibility to be a personal witness within the common mission of spreading the good news (CCC#878).\n\n---\n\n**Q. 460: Both the first reading (Is 8:23-9:3) and gospel (Matt 4:12-23) make a point of referring to the old tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali. What is going on here?**\n\nAssyrian, Babylonian, and Roman invaders always came from “the north” – meaning they followed the trade routes and river routes. Two of Jacob’s sons, Zebulun and Naphtali, were apportioned territory west and north of the Sea of Galilee. Therefore, they would be the first to feel the brunt of an attack from an invading force. In fact, when Assyria destroyed the kingdom of Northern Israel around 720 BC, Zebulun and Naphtali were the first tribal lands to fall into the hands of the enemy. Later the Roman army would occupy the territory. Note that this area would include the towns of Nazareth and Capernaum.\n\nBut Isaiah prophesies that the “darkness” of oppression would be dispelled by a new “light”; God would deliver his people and remove the “yoke” of the taskmaster from them. Once again there would be joy and rejoicing.\n\nMatthew’s gospel shows that this prophecy was fulfilled by Jesus Christ. The evangelist makes a deliberate connection between the ministry of Jesus and the old Isaian prophecy.

Surely they had forgotten their story, the story that made them the chosen people of God.\n\nStories help us to know who we are. Today, find your old photo albums. Tell the younger ones how your family members' faith traditions made a difference to them and/or their communities, and to you. Then share with them about why it is important to read the Bible daily as a means to help us understand who we are and how to live.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Jesus' message clearly indicated that he was the one sent by the Father to inaugurate the kingdom of God (CCC #436). The prophets of the Old Testament had announced that the Spirit of the Lord would rest on the Messiah for his saving mission (#1286). Tell your children! It is part of our faith tradition!\n\n---\n\n**The Word of the Lord**\n\nToday we hear the prophet Ezra reading the scroll of God's word to the people. They have been in long exile because of their sins and they weep over the devastated land to which they have returned. Ezra doesn't just read the word of the Lord; he interprets it \"today is holy to the Lord your God. Do not be sad and do not weep.\" They are told to learn from their mistakes and that God is merciful. Jesus too reads from the scriptures and interprets them by identifying himself with the messianic figure in the readings. \"The spirit of the Lord is upon me...he has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and glad tidings to the poor. Today this is fulfilled in your hearing.\"\n\n_Lord, help us to learn from our mistakes and failures and learn that the Lord our God is merciful._",

A Swedish Lutheran, aged thirty, he was employed as first secretary of the Swedish legation in Hungary in the early 1940&apos;s. He had wheedled from the King of Sweden, his diplomatic appointment to Budapest for precisely the purpose of rescuing victims. He had also wheedled from the King the authorization to give asylum to anybody who held a Swedish protective pass. Handing out protective passes to Hungarian Jews kept him constantly on the go, but by means of protective passes, he was able to save the lives of 100,000 Jewish people.</p>\n<p>One day, for example, Raoul learned that a crowd of Jewish Hungarians had been corralled and packed into a train for a Nazi extermination camp. He reached the railroad station just in the nick of time. Brushing by the Nazi guard, he climbed on the roof of the train and moved along from car to car handing Swedish passes through the open doors and windows. The German officers ordered him down. The Hungarian Nazis shot at him. Nevertheless, Raoul finished his work calmly and efficiently. Then he got down and shouted, &quot;All who have passes leave this train!&quot; The pass-holders came out and he directed them to a fleet of autos bearing Swedish flags. Thus, he saved the lives of dozens of Jews, and the Nazis were too befuddled by his quick strategy to do anything about it.</p>\n<p>In 1945 Raoul Wallenberg was finally arrested. Some think he may still be a prisoner in a Russian camp.

(Today&apos;s gospel). In coming to Elizabeth&apos;s aid, she also brought the unborn Jesus into the presence of the unborn St. John the Baptist.

Surely &quot;charity&quot; stands out, as Mary comes to help Elizabeth. Mary is a model for love of neighbor.

For nothing is impossible with God&quot; (Luke, 1:37. Gospel of the day).</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q. 350: In today&#x2019;s gospel (Luke 1:26-38), a divine messenger (Gabriel) brings Mary the awesome news of the forthcoming Incarnation of the Messiah, and we hear the Blessed Virgin Mary&#x2019;s assent. Other than &#x201C;rejoicing&#x201D; at the memory of this long-awaited Good News, where can my meditation take me?</strong></p>\n<p>Mary&#x2019;s response to God can lead us in many directions, but today let&#x2019;s focus on just two points. The context, of course, is Mary&#x2019;s humble submission of her will to God&#x2019;s will in all things, and the fact that the &#x201C;birthing process&#x201D; began at that very moment of her &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>There is a Dominican mystic from the 14th century that is often quoted, because his words capture so well our own participation in this birthing process. Meister Eckhart asks the questions that we all ought to consider. First he asks: &#x201C;What good is it to me for the Creator to give birth to his Son if I do not also give birth to him in my time and my culture?&#x201D; Mary&#x2019;s &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; that brought Christ to the world is not just a &#x201C;memory event,&#x201D; such as recalling Babe Ruth or Tiger Woods setting records to remember. Instead, it ought to lead us to ponder how to imitate her: how can I bring Christ to the daily world that I live and participate in? Do I reflect Christ in what I say and do? Am I a true disciple, like Mary the model disciple?</p>\n<p>A second question that Meister Eckhart asks: &#x201C;What good is it to me if this eternal birth of the divine Son . . . does not take place within myself?&#x201D; When God comes to dwell within us at our Baptism, we are empowered to live the Christ-life, one oriented to loving God and Neighbor. Do I see that orientation in my own heart, or am I still oriented to selfishness? Do I humbly submit to all of the teachings of the Magisterium of the Church, without exception, so that its wisdom can grow in my heart?</p>\n<p>In summary, in a sense your personal meditation can parallel Mary&#x2019;s journey: have I truly given an unqualified &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; to Jesus in my own life, and what is the best way for me to bring this Good News to my own little world?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Mary and all the Saints have one thing in common: they &#x201C;will His will alone&#x201D; (CCC #2827). This is our life, our desire and our destiny: &#x201C;Behold I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to Your word&#x201D; (CCC #2817). Mary is the perfect model of the &#x201C;obedience of faith&#x201D; that we disciples are all called to imitate (CCC #148).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q507: I am not called to be &#x201C;Mother of God,&#x201D; so how can today&#x2019;s gospel (Lk 1:26-38) speak to me?</strong></p>\n<p>Can you imagine the wonder and excitement that must have been stirred up in Mary&#x2019;s heart?

In later centuries, too, the Spirit has launched the church in certain places with miraculous assistance. One fascinating case was the apostolate to the Jumanos Indians of New Mexico in the early seventeenth century.</p>\n<p>Spanish Franciscan missionaries established their first Indian mission in New Mexico in 1622 at Pueblo Isleta. About a year later, a delegation of Indians from a distant tribe, the Jumanos, called on the friars at Isleta and asked that a mission be set up in their own pueblo. Sorry, the friars said, they couldn&apos;t oblige, for they were too few in numbers. For the next three years, however, a band of Jumanos Indians put in an annual appearance, repeating the invitation, receiving the same reply. Finally, in 1627, 30 new missionaries arrived. Scarcely had they reached Isleta when they were greeted by a party of 50 Jumanos - the largest yet. Now the friars asked them, &quot;Who told you to come to us for missionaries?&quot; &quot;We were sent,&quot; they said, &quot;by a beautiful woman in a veil and a blue cloak.&quot; &quot;Why didn&apos;t you tell us that before?&quot; the Franciscans replied. &quot;Because you didn&apos;t ask us,&quot; they answered. &quot;Anyhow, we thought she was around here, too.&quot;</p>\n<p>The friars already suspected something extraordinary was going on. There was in Spain in those days a Sister Maria Coronel, a very holy woman who had founded a monastery at Agreda. Her nuns wore blue cloaks. When examined by church authorities in 1627, she said that by the mystical gift of &quot;bi-location&quot; (being, or seeming to be, in two places at the same time) she had been miraculously transported across the Atlantic hundreds of times to teach the Indians of the Southwest. (The case was amply documented not only by her own testimony, but by that of Indians in three Southwest states.) What she did when she came (without ever leaving Agreda) was to tell them of Christ and the cross and urge them to seek out missionaries and baptism.</p>\n<p>When the long-sought for friars set out for the Jumanos country, they were greeted before their arrival by a procession of these pagan Indians carrying crosses. The tribesmen knelt devoutly before the Franciscans and kissed the crosses of their crucifixes. How had they learned such a proper way to greet the priests? Because Mother Mary had just come over again and told them &quot;Here they come. Welcome them thus and so!&quot;</p>\n<p>I doubt that the whole Jumanos nation was as numerous a population as was the three thousand who joined the Church on the first Pentecost. But they were docile listeners; and thanks to this special wonder wrought by God, they came into His church in large numbers.</p>\n<p>- Fr. Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q471: 3,000 new members in one day (Acts 2:36-41)?

In later centuries, too, the Spirit has launched the church in certain places with miraculous assistance. One fascinating case was the apostolate to the Jumanos Indians of New Mexico in the early seventeenth century.\n\nSpanish Franciscan missionaries established their first Indian mission in New Mexico in 1622 at Pueblo Isleta. About a year later, a delegation of Indians from a distant tribe, the Jumanos, called on the friars at Isleta and asked that a mission be set up in their own pueblo. Sorry, the friars said, they couldn't oblige, for they were too few in numbers. For the next three years, however, a band of Jumanos Indians put in an annual appearance, repeating the invitation, receiving the same reply. Finally, in 1627, 30 new missionaries arrived. Scarcely had they reached Isleta when they were greeted by a party of 50 Jumanos - the largest yet. Now the friars asked them, \"Who told you to come to us for missionaries?\" \"We were sent,\" they said, \"by a beautiful woman in a veil and a blue cloak.\" \"Why didn't you tell us that before?\" the Franciscans replied. \"Because you didn't ask us,\" they answered. \"Anyhow, we thought she was around here, too.\"\n\nThe friars already suspected something extraordinary was going on. There was in Spain in those days a Sister Maria Coronel, a very holy woman who had founded a monastery at Agreda. Her nuns wore blue cloaks. When examined by church authorities in 1627, she said that by the mystical gift of \"bi-location\" (being, or seeming to be, in two places at the same time) she had been miraculously transported across the Atlantic hundreds of times to teach the Indians of the Southwest. (The case was amply documented not only by her own testimony, but by that of Indians in three Southwest states.) What she did when she came (without ever leaving Agreda) was to tell them of Christ and the cross and urge them to seek out missionaries and baptism.\n\nWhen the long-sought for friars set out for the Jumanos country, they were greeted before their arrival by a procession of these pagan Indians carrying crosses. The tribesmen knelt devoutly before the Franciscans and kissed the crosses of their crucifixes. How had they learned such a proper way to greet the priests? Because Mother Mary had just come over again and told them \"Here they come. Welcome them thus and so!\"\n\nI doubt that the whole Jumanos nation was as numerous a population as was the three thousand who joined the Church on the first Pentecost. But they were docile listeners; and thanks to this special wonder wrought by God, they came into His church in large numbers.\n\n\\- Fr. Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q471: 3,000 new members in one day (Acts 2:36-41)? Why don’t we see that happening in our Church now?**\n\nThere is not enough space to respond adequately!

He in turn knows them as individuals and treats them as a loving father. He will protect them at all costs against anybody who will try to &quot;snatch them out of his hand&quot; (Today&apos;s gospel). If one of them should stray, he leaves the rest in a safe place and goes off through brush and briar in search of the wanderer.

Of Jesus he said, &quot;When He found wandering in the mountains and hills the one sheep that had strayed from God&apos;s flock of a hundred, he brought it back into the fold, but He did not exhaust it by driving it. Instead He placed it on His shoulders and so compassionately, He restored it safely to the flock&quot;.</p>\n<p>In this &quot;Holy Year of Redemption&quot;, Jesus, our good shepherd, calls on us, the sheep of his fold, to return to Him, whether we have wandered far or near.

It involves three interacting groups: an engaged duke and queen and their courts, the king and queen of the fairies and their Sprites, especially the mischievous Puck; and a group of lower-class craftsmen who are rehearsing a play &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot; to present at the duke&apos;s wedding.</p>\n<p>The craftsmen are: the play director, Quince, a carpenter; the &quot;star&quot;, Bottom, a weaver; Flute, a bellows-mender, Snout, a tinker, Snug, a joiner, and Starveling, a tailor. They have their human failings, broadly sketched. They also have their virtues: mutual respect; regard for their audience; and, especially, a nice innocence of conversation.</p>\n<p>These virtues are illustrated in the following dialogue when they gather to rehearse. Quince: &quot;Have you sent to Bottom&apos;s house? Is he home yet?&quot; Flute: &quot;If he come not, then the play is marr&apos;d. It goes not forward, doth it?&quot; Quince: &quot;It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.&quot; Flute: &quot;No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraftsman in Athens.&quot; Snout: &quot;Yea, and the best person, too; and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.&quot; Flute: &quot;You must say `paragon&apos;; a paramour is, God bless us, a thing of naught.&quot; Snout had innocently confused &quot;paragon&quot; (an ideal) with &quot;paramour&quot; (an unlawful lover) ... Flute gently told him that paramours are something the decent Christian does not discuss.</p>\n<p>In today&apos;s second lesson St. Paul establishes this Christian principle of what is inappropriate for conversation.</p>\n<p>&quot;Take no part in vain deeds done in darkness; rather, condemn them. It is shameful even to mention the things these people do in secret.&quot; A few lines above in his epistle Paul has said &quot;as for lewd conduct or promiscuousness or lust of any sort, let them not even be mentioned among you; your holiness forbids this. Nor should there be any obscene, silly or suggestive talk, all that is out of place.&quot;</p>\n<p>Today sex is widely discussed and obscenity is widely used. The media are certainly to blame in large part for setting a bad example by their lack of restraint in this regard. They would be far more responsible if they heeded St. Paul&apos;s admonition: Never let evil talk pass your lips; say only the good things men need to know that will really help them (Eph. 4:29).</p>\n<p>I doubt we can quickly talk the media back into decency. But if we can ourselves respect our own holiness and the dignity of our neighbor, we will be careful to heed St. Paul&apos;s rules of decent conversation, as well as the admirable example set by Shakespeare&apos;s bellow-maker, Flute.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F.

We tend to judge others based on exterior qualities; but God looks into the heart of every person and knows the &#x201C;real&#x201D; identity of everyone.</p>\n<p>The Prophet Samuel (1st Reading: 1 Samuel 16) makes that lesson explicit when he points to David, the youngest of Jesse&#x2019;s eight sons, and identifies him as God&#x2019;s choice to be king of Israel. &#x201C;Primogeniture&#x201D; was a legal concept in Old Testament law that gave privileged inheritance rights to the eldest son.

    "markdown": "**Shameful even to mention**\n\nShakespeare's \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" is a delicious fantasy. It involves three interacting groups: an engaged duke and queen and their courts, the king and queen of the fairies and their Sprites, especially the mischievous Puck; and a group of lower-class craftsmen who are rehearsing a play \"Pyramus and Thisbe\" to present at the duke's wedding.\n\nThe craftsmen are: the play director, Quince, a carpenter; the \"star\", Bottom, a weaver; Flute, a bellows-mender, Snout, a tinker, Snug, a joiner, and Starveling, a tailor. They have their human failings, broadly sketched. They also have their virtues: mutual respect; regard for their audience; and, especially, a nice innocence of conversation.\n\nThese virtues are illustrated in the following dialogue when they gather to rehearse. Quince: \"Have you sent to Bottom's house? Is he home yet?\" Flute: \"If he come not, then the play is marr'd. It goes not forward, doth it?\" Quince: \"It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.\" Flute: \"No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraftsman in Athens.\" Snout: \"Yea, and the best person, too; and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.\" Flute: \"You must say \\`paragon'; a paramour is, God bless us, a thing of naught.\" Snout had innocently confused \"paragon\" (an ideal) with \"paramour\" (an unlawful lover) ... Flute gently told him that paramours are something the decent Christian does not discuss.\n\nIn today's second lesson St. Paul establishes this Christian principle of what is inappropriate for conversation.\n\n\"Take no part in vain deeds done in darkness; rather, condemn them. It is shameful even to mention the things these people do in secret.\" A few lines above in his epistle Paul has said \"as for lewd conduct or promiscuousness or lust of any sort, let them not even be mentioned among you; your holiness forbids this. Nor should there be any obscene, silly or suggestive talk, all that is out of place.\"\n\nToday sex is widely discussed and obscenity is widely used. The media are certainly to blame in large part for setting a bad example by their lack of restraint in this regard. They would be far more responsible if they heeded St. Paul's admonition: Never let evil talk pass your lips; say only the good things men need to know that will really help them (Eph. 4:29).\n\nI doubt we can quickly talk the media back into decency. But if we can ourselves respect our own holiness and the dignity of our neighbor, we will be careful to heed St. Paul's rules of decent conversation, as well as the admirable example set by Shakespeare's bellow-maker, Flute.\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q465: Why does God seem to make “politically incorrect” decisions by choosing the most unlikely candidate for important positions?**\n\nThese readings are great lessons about who can really “see,” and how each one of us must trust in the light of Christ as we make our pilgrim’s progress back to our heavenly Father. We tend to judge others based on exterior qualities; but God looks into the heart of every person and knows the “real” identity of everyone.\n\nThe Prophet Samuel (1st Reading: 1 Samuel 16) makes that lesson explicit when he points to David, the youngest of Jesse’s eight sons, and identifies him as God’s choice to be king of Israel. “Primogeniture” was a legal concept in Old Testament law that gave privileged inheritance rights to the eldest son. But God is not bound by man’s way of looking at things. One might be the strongest, or the smartest, or the oldest, or the richest sibling. But those things don’t matter to God; he looks into our hearts, and “sees” our basic disposition and attitude towards both God and others. Only those qualities of love and justice matter in the eyes of God.\n\nIn the Gospel (John 9), it is the man who was blind from birth who is able to “see.” The leaders of the Pharisees, on the other hand, who knew the man had been blind but could now see, were unable to “see” the power of God at work in Jesus. So it was really those leaders who were “blind” all the time. But the formerly-blind man is now brought to belief in Jesus by stages, as he opens his heart to permit God to work his transforming power in his life. Is this not the story of our own lives?\n\nThere are two levels of “seeing” – the physical level and the spiritual level. Only the person whose heart is open to God can see the deeper meaning of his miracles and parables.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Jesus was very clear: those who pretend not to need salvation are blind to their own sinfulness (CCC #588). Jesus worked this miracle on the Sabbath, the “day of the Lord of mercies” (CCC #2173). Jesus is God’s “anointed” in a way quite unique from that of David, since Jesus was anointed to be “Messiah” – God’s anointed (CCC #695).\n\n---\n\n**Lord, That I May See**\n\nToday's gospel is a beautiful portrayal of Jesus' wonderful power for good, proof of his divine mission.

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>Salvation through faith ... God&apos;s gift</strong></p>\n<p>In the wars of religion that followed the Protestant Reformation, both Catholics and Protestants sometimes treated each other with a cruelty we would like to forget.</p>\n<p>Especially cruel were a group of fanatical Calvinists who waged war upon the Catholics of Holland. They called themselves the &quot;Ragamuffins.&quot; In 1572 these guerrillas rounded up nineteen Catholic priests and friars in the town of Gorkum, both because they despised their beliefs, and because they hoped they would confess where their church &quot;treasures&quot; were hidden. The captors made public mockery of their &quot;hostages&quot; and then put them &quot;on trial,&quot; demanding that they deny the authority of the pope and the doctrine of the Real Presence. Meanwhile, the Prince of Orange, head of the Calvinist army, sent an order that the captives be released. The Ragamuffins ignored their leader&apos;s order. Herding the captives into a shed, they prepared to hang them from its beams, unless they would finally deny their Catholic faith. When all nineteen refused, they were hanged and their bodies were mutilated.</p>\n<p>Now, although there were some saintly men among the victims, two of them did not have good records. James Lacops, a member of the Norbertine Fathers, had made light of the rule of his order, and when rebuked had resisted his superiors. Fortunately, he had made amends. But Andreas Wouters, a secular priest, had scandalized many by flagrantly ignoring his vow of chastity. Yet when these unlikely men had been asked to deny their faith, they had stood firm. Far from being &quot;other Christs&quot; in their lives, they had truly become &quot;other Christs&quot; in their death. With the rest of their fellow martyrs they were canonized as saints in 1867.</p>\n<p>God&apos;s grace is always free. The human mind can never appreciate the extent of His generosity . . . Salvation ... is not your own doing ... neither is it a reward for anything you have accomplished so let no one pride himself on it. (Ephesians, 2.8-9. Today&apos;s first reading).</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>B208: All Christians &quot;love the light&quot; just by believing in Jesus, don&apos;t they? Is John&apos;s Gospel today (Jn 3:14-21) pointing in a direction other than towards me?</strong></p>\n<p>It depends on exactly what you believe and how you have informed your conscience. John points out that people who do &quot;evil works&quot; prefer darkness; people who do &quot;wicked things&quot; hate the light, and don&apos;t come near it or else they would be &quot;exposed.&quot; The Roman Catholic Church has the promise of the presence of the Holy Spirit until the end of time, to preserve it from error in faith and morals. Therefore we do not stand &quot;in the light&quot; if we do not follow the official teachings of the Magisterium, readily found in the New Catechism of the Catholic Church.</p>\n<p>A few modern examples of &quot;wicked things&quot; or &quot;evil works&quot; will help illustrate this. The Church teaches that some actions are objectively evil by their very nature and choice, such as procured abortions, vasectomies, contraception and euthanasia. These are choices against life and are gravely disordered behaviors. Other actions are objectively evil because they are offenses against chastity and are gravely disordered behaviors - examples are prostitution, masturbation, homosexual acts, fornication, and lust. There are many other choices that are objectively evil, and to accept them as &quot;okay to choose&quot; will place one in dire spiritual danger. &quot;Pro-choice&quot; positions are inherently dangerous by definition, and not acceptable because they allow, tolerate and even encourage objectively evil behavior such as the examples given above. It is to our disgrace as a Nation and as its Citizens that apparently we cannot see that we are &quot;living in darkness&quot; and are even driving out all reference to God in our schools, institutions, and society.

    "markdown": "**Salvation through faith ... God's gift**\n\nIn the wars of religion that followed the Protestant Reformation, both Catholics and Protestants sometimes treated each other with a cruelty we would like to forget.\n\nEspecially cruel were a group of fanatical Calvinists who waged war upon the Catholics of Holland. They called themselves the \"Ragamuffins.\" In 1572 these guerrillas rounded up nineteen Catholic priests and friars in the town of Gorkum, both because they despised their beliefs, and because they hoped they would confess where their church \"treasures\" were hidden. The captors made public mockery of their \"hostages\" and then put them \"on trial,\" demanding that they deny the authority of the pope and the doctrine of the Real Presence. Meanwhile, the Prince of Orange, head of the Calvinist army, sent an order that the captives be released. The Ragamuffins ignored their leader's order. Herding the captives into a shed, they prepared to hang them from its beams, unless they would finally deny their Catholic faith. When all nineteen refused, they were hanged and their bodies were mutilated.\n\nNow, although there were some saintly men among the victims, two of them did not have good records. James Lacops, a member of the Norbertine Fathers, had made light of the rule of his order, and when rebuked had resisted his superiors. Fortunately, he had made amends. But Andreas Wouters, a secular priest, had scandalized many by flagrantly ignoring his vow of chastity. Yet when these unlikely men had been asked to deny their faith, they had stood firm. Far from being \"other Christs\" in their lives, they had truly become \"other Christs\" in their death. With the rest of their fellow martyrs they were canonized as saints in 1867.\n\nGod's grace is always free. The human mind can never appreciate the extent of His generosity . . . Salvation ... is not your own doing ... neither is it a reward for anything you have accomplished so let no one pride himself on it. (Ephesians, 2.8-9. Today's first reading).\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**B208: All Christians \"love the light\" just by believing in Jesus, don't they? Is John's Gospel today (Jn 3:14-21) pointing in a direction other than towards me?**\n\nIt depends on exactly what you believe and how you have informed your conscience. John points out that people who do \"evil works\" prefer darkness; people who do \"wicked things\" hate the light, and don't come near it or else they would be \"exposed.\" The Roman Catholic Church has the promise of the presence of the Holy Spirit until the end of time, to preserve it from error in faith and morals. Therefore we do not stand \"in the light\" if we do not follow the official teachings of the Magisterium, readily found in the New Catechism of the Catholic Church.\n\nA few modern examples of \"wicked things\" or \"evil works\" will help illustrate this. The Church teaches that some actions are objectively evil by their very nature and choice, such as procured abortions, vasectomies, contraception and euthanasia. These are choices against life and are gravely disordered behaviors. Other actions are objectively evil because they are offenses against chastity and are gravely disordered behaviors - examples are prostitution, masturbation, homosexual acts, fornication, and lust. There are many other choices that are objectively evil, and to accept them as \"okay to choose\" will place one in dire spiritual danger. \"Pro-choice\" positions are inherently dangerous by definition, and not acceptable because they allow, tolerate and even encourage objectively evil behavior such as the examples given above. It is to our disgrace as a Nation and as its Citizens that apparently we cannot see that we are \"living in darkness\" and are even driving out all reference to God in our schools, institutions, and society. One national party even has a plank in its platform defending one's right to choose this behavior, which is unacceptable to a Roman Catholic.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** You can find the Church's teaching in many places (CCC# 2271; 2277; 2351-70; etc). What about your behavior toward institutions that perpetuate these crimes: do you vote for those taking a stand against objectively evil behavior, or are you a passive onlooker? Such passivity puts you in the \"darkness\" rather than in the \"light\" of Jesus Christ! Do you need to do some Lenten soul-searching? Reflection: Do you think God hears prayers that ask for His protection of a society that encourages the wicked behavior above?\n\n---\n\n**Rejoice, Be Joyful!**\n\nThis Fourth Sunday of Lent used to be called Laetare Sunday because the Mass began with the word “Laetare” which means “rejoice.” The Liturgy of the Word gives us reasons for rejoicing. The introductory verse: “Rejoice Jerusalem, be glad for her…” is taken from the prophet Isaiah who rejoices in anticipation of God’s future restoration of his people and of the holy city. We see the fulfillment of that promise in the first reading when the Persian king Cyrus becomes the instrument of God’s redemption.  \nThe Gospel gives us even better reasons for rejoicing. Moses lifted up on a pole an image of the serpent so that those bitten by the serpents might live. In the same way Jesus is lifted up on the cross so that we might live forever. With his fondness for double meanings St. John takes us farther. “Lifting up” can also mean “to be exalted,” to elevate in honor and power.” For John the crucifixion is the hour of Jesus’ glorification, the moment of his victory over sin and death, the throne of his glory, his coronation as king of the Jews and savior of the world. Jesus who came down from heaven begins his ascent back to the Father. For us too the cross is the road that leads to resurrection and glory.\n\n_Father, we fear the cross and shrink away from it. Give us the courage to take up our cross and the strength to carry it so that we too may come to share in the glory of your Son, Jesus the Christ._",

Then good King Josiah began to reign, and the prophets began to speak again. This time they spoke of impending doom. Even Jerusalem was going to be destroyed, because God&#x2019;s judgment, &#x201C;the Day of the Lord,&#x201D; would soon be experienced.

What distinguished them from their fellow Israelites was not so much their wealth or lack of it but their awareness of their utter dependence on God. They were overwhelmed by their powerlessness and trusted totally in God to save them on the day of reckoning. So to be &quot;poor in spirit&quot; is to know one&apos;s need for God.

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>He taught with authority</strong></p>\n<p>There were many learned scribes and rabbis in Jesus&apos; day, and the Jewish people would often refer religious questions to them because they were so knowledgeable. An appeal could be frustrating, however. More often than not, the scribes could cite all the opinions on any religious question, but were unable to state with assurance which was the correct opinion.</p>\n<p>That is why Jesus&apos; teaching was so attractive to devout questioners. When they asked for a definite solution, He would as much as say, &quot;This is it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Of course, nobody could ever match Our Lord in giving the right answer. Still, there have been brilliant people so deeply acquainted with their own field of learning that one could depend on them to give a final response to practically every question.</p>\n<p>One such scholar was the famous George Lyman Kittredge, for years a professor of English literature at Harvard University. Having received his bachelor&apos;s degree at Harvard, he showed such talent that the University engaged him as a teacher. This was long before the degree of doctor of philosophy was demanded of university faculty members or, indeed, was even a popular degree in America. Professor Kittredge, A.B. soon became one of the world&apos;s most learned men in English literature. For decades his courses on Shakespeare were the most popular courses taught at Harvard.</p>\n<p>Every now and then, in his later years, some of his students would ask him, &quot;Why don&apos;t you study for a doctorate of philosophy?</p>\n<p>The brusque bearded old scholar always had the same answer, &quot;Who would examine me?&quot;</p>\n<p>...A completely new teaching in a spirit of authority! (Mark, 1-27. Today&apos;s Gospel).</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q356: What is the difference between the power and authority of the Scribes, as contrasted with that of Jesus in today&#x2019;s gospel (Mk 1:21-28)?</strong></p>\n<p>Six years ago, a Methodist preacher friend asked me if I knew the difference between &#x201C;power&#x201D; and &#x201C;authority.&#x201D; Then he gave an illustration of the difference. Suppose, he said, that you&apos;re sitting at a traffic light, in the middle lane, waiting for the light to change. On your left is a Dodge Viper, with about a zillion horsepower, just waiting to streak away like a shot. That is power! On your right is the biggest, shiniest eighteen-wheeler you ever saw, with chromium exhaust pipes and a cab that looks two stories tall, and it is rumbling like a thousand snarling lions, waiting for the light to change. That&apos;s power!</p>\n<p>But just before the light begins to change, you see a State Policeman, in shiny boots and spit-and-polish uniform. His car is parked across the way. He is evidently filling in for the school crossing guard. He walks to the center of the street and holds up his hand. All the traffic comes to a stop. You wait. The Viper waits. The eighteen-wheeler waits. And a tiny little girl with a backpack walks kitty-corner across the busy intersection. The rumbling engines may have power. But he has the authority!</p>\n<p>Just like the drivers in the outside and inside lanes, the Scribes could make a lot of noise and show off a lot with their pretentious knowledge, arguing from sunrise to sunset on obscure points of law. But only Jesus had both power and authority that was recognized by demons, and also the power and authority to command their instant, unquestioning obedience. Here is the point: the Scribes never yielded to the wisdom and truth of Jesus Christ. Now it is your turn: will you recognize, trust and yield to the authority of Jesus, or will you follow your own opinions?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Jesus delegated his Mission to his chosen disciples, the Apostles, who passed it on to their successors, the Bishops (CCC #2034). Will you recognize, trust and yield to their authority (which comes from Jesus Christ), or just cling to your own opinions? Are you a proud scribe or a humble disciple?</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>If Today You Hear His Voice, Harden Not Your Hearts</strong></p>\n<p>Many Americans associate prophets with foretelling the future, but the book of Deuteronomy tells us that a prophet is not primarily a forecaster of the future, but rather one who speaks for God, someone whose words have divine authority, someone whose words we can ignore only at our peril. But Scripture also warns us that not everyone who claims to speak for God really does. So we have to learn discernment -- how listen to a prophet, but also checking out his authority. One way of doing this is to ask, &#x201D;Who benefits?&#x201D; If the so called prophet is the chief beneficiary, we ought to be wary. Today&#x2019;s gospel speaks of Jesus as the prophet promised to Moses. He teaches in the synagogue with authority; he doesn&#x2019;t quote this scribe or that teacher to support his words. He is the Word of God speaking; he never speaks or acts for his own benefit. He acts out of compassion to free us from the burden of ignorance of God.

    "markdown": "**He taught with authority**\n\nThere were many learned scribes and rabbis in Jesus' day, and the Jewish people would often refer religious questions to them because they were so knowledgeable. An appeal could be frustrating, however. More often than not, the scribes could cite all the opinions on any religious question, but were unable to state with assurance which was the correct opinion.\n\nThat is why Jesus' teaching was so attractive to devout questioners. When they asked for a definite solution, He would as much as say, \"This is it.\"\n\nOf course, nobody could ever match Our Lord in giving the right answer. Still, there have been brilliant people so deeply acquainted with their own field of learning that one could depend on them to give a final response to practically every question.\n\nOne such scholar was the famous George Lyman Kittredge, for years a professor of English literature at Harvard University. Having received his bachelor's degree at Harvard, he showed such talent that the University engaged him as a teacher. This was long before the degree of doctor of philosophy was demanded of university faculty members or, indeed, was even a popular degree in America. Professor Kittredge, A.B. soon became one of the world's most learned men in English literature. For decades his courses on Shakespeare were the most popular courses taught at Harvard.\n\nEvery now and then, in his later years, some of his students would ask him, \"Why don't you study for a doctorate of philosophy?\n\nThe brusque bearded old scholar always had the same answer, \"Who would examine me?\"\n\n...A completely new teaching in a spirit of authority! (Mark, 1-27. Today's Gospel).\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q356: What is the difference between the power and authority of the Scribes, as contrasted with that of Jesus in today’s gospel (Mk 1:21-28)?**\n\nSix years ago, a Methodist preacher friend asked me if I knew the difference between “power” and “authority.” Then he gave an illustration of the difference. Suppose, he said, that you're sitting at a traffic light, in the middle lane, waiting for the light to change. On your left is a Dodge Viper, with about a zillion horsepower, just waiting to streak away like a shot. That is power! On your right is the biggest, shiniest eighteen-wheeler you ever saw, with chromium exhaust pipes and a cab that looks two stories tall, and it is rumbling like a thousand snarling lions, waiting for the light to change. That's power!\n\nBut just before the light begins to change, you see a State Policeman, in shiny boots and spit-and-polish uniform. His car is parked across the way. He is evidently filling in for the school crossing guard. He walks to the center of the street and holds up his hand. All the traffic comes to a stop. You wait. The Viper waits. The eighteen-wheeler waits. And a tiny little girl with a backpack walks kitty-corner across the busy intersection. The rumbling engines may have power. But he has the authority!\n\nJust like the drivers in the outside and inside lanes, the Scribes could make a lot of noise and show off a lot with their pretentious knowledge, arguing from sunrise to sunset on obscure points of law. But only Jesus had both power and authority that was recognized by demons, and also the power and authority to command their instant, unquestioning obedience. Here is the point: the Scribes never yielded to the wisdom and truth of Jesus Christ. Now it is your turn: will you recognize, trust and yield to the authority of Jesus, or will you follow your own opinions?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Jesus delegated his Mission to his chosen disciples, the Apostles, who passed it on to their successors, the Bishops (CCC #2034). Will you recognize, trust and yield to their authority (which comes from Jesus Christ), or just cling to your own opinions? Are you a proud scribe or a humble disciple?\n\n---\n\n**If Today You Hear His Voice, Harden Not Your Hearts**\n\nMany Americans associate prophets with foretelling the future, but the book of Deuteronomy tells us that a prophet is not primarily a forecaster of the future, but rather one who speaks for God, someone whose words have divine authority, someone whose words we can ignore only at our peril. But Scripture also warns us that not everyone who claims to speak for God really does. So we have to learn discernment -- how listen to a prophet, but also checking out his authority. One way of doing this is to ask, ”Who benefits?” If the so called prophet is the chief beneficiary, we ought to be wary. Today’s gospel speaks of Jesus as the prophet promised to Moses. He teaches in the synagogue with authority; he doesn’t quote this scribe or that teacher to support his words. He is the Word of God speaking; he never speaks or acts for his own benefit. He acts out of compassion to free us from the burden of ignorance of God. With equal authority he frees the possessed from the power of evil. He speaks and acts always for the benefit of others. At every Mass we encounter Jesus teaching and working wonders. How well do I listen? How do I apply his words to my life\n\n_Lord, when you speak to us today through Paul or Mark or John, Open my ears to hear; soften the hardness of my heart and help me to act on what I have heard_.",

Loucks, a bachelor and a veteran of the Civil War, died in 1934 at the Soldiers&apos; Home in Bath, New York, he bequeathed $200 to St. John&apos;s Orphanage in Utica, New York, and $100 to the Sisters of St. Joseph at Little Falls, N.Y. His will also instructed the administrators of his estate, the Herkimer Co. Trust Co., to use the residue &quot;for Masses for the repose of myself and my brother, Daniel.&quot; Since the thrifty veteran had saved $10,000 from his humble employment as a farmer&apos;s helper, road worker, and shoemaker, that meant that some $7,000 was to go for Mass offerings.</p>\n<p>Now, the president of the Herkimer Co. Trust Co. was puzzled about this last matter. He decided that the residue should be invested, and only the interest used for Masses. When this decision came to the attention of the bishop of Rochester, in whose diocese Mr. Loucks died, the bishop replied that Church law required that the whole sum should go for Masses. In fact, he felt obliged to take the case to court.</p>\n<p>Finally, three years later, the judge surrogate of Steuben County ruled that in this instance Church law took precedence over Civil law. As soon as the total residue was consigned to the bishop, he saw to it that, after this three-year wait, Masses finally began to be offered according to the old artilleryman&apos;s intentions.</p>\n<p>Who was James Loucks, whose dying wish was the celebration of several thousands of Masses? His religious history was most interesting, according to newsman James B. Hutchinson.</p>\n<p>Born to Protestant parents in 1844 at Manheim, Herkimer County N.Y., Jim enlisted in 1863 in Co. H. of the 2nd New York Heavy Artillery. He saw action in the Pennsylvania campaigns of the Civil War from Cold Harbor on. Up to that time, he had had little or no contact with Catholics. But one thing that impressed him deeply as the war continued was the great work the Sisters of Charity were doing with the victims of the battlefield. If they are so caring, he thought, then the Church they represent must be a loving church.</p>\n<p>Then came the battle of Gettysburg - vast, bloody, frightening. In the midst of it, Jim vowed &quot;If the Almighty God spares me in this war, I will become a Catholic! &quot;</p>\n<p>God did spare him, and he kept his pledge. When mustered out of service, he went to work on a farm near Little Falls, N.Y., where he approached Father James Ludden of St. Mary&apos;s Church, Little Falls. Eventually received into the Church, he became an active Catholic; deeply religious and much given to reading and study of the faith. Between 1877 and 1885 he served as sexton of St. Mary&apos;s. At the age of 69, he retired to the Soldiers&apos; Home at Bath.</p>\n<p>Our words of praise for the Catholic faith can often win others to join the Church. Even more persuasive than Catholic words, however, are Catholic deeds. It was the good deeds of the Sisters of Charity that moved Jim Loucks to become a Catholic. In today&apos;s gospel, Our Lord makes much the same point: &quot;Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else, believe because of the works I do.&quot;</p>\n<p>Does our daily Christian life impress others to think well of our Church?</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q316: Why all the &#x201C;new titles&#x201D; for the early Christians in Peter&#x2019;s epistle (1 Pt 2:4-9), and what do they mean for me today?</strong></p>\n<p>The author uses the image of a &#x201C;living stone&#x201D; for Jesus Christ, discarded by the very ones he came to teach. Since they, the old covenant &#x201C;builders,&#x201D; have discarded the most important &#x201C;stone&#x201D; of all, the foundation stone, it now becomes their biggest stumbling block.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, for those who do believe in Jesus and his word and works, as well as his identity as the Messiah and only Son of God, this &#x201C;living stone&#x201D; has immeasurable value. Because of their faith, believers receive four new &#x201C;titles&#x201D; that previously had been reserved for the Jewish people in the Old Covenant.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A chosen race,&#x201D; because we have received the seal of the Spirit of God at our baptism. &#x201C;A royal priesthood,&#x201D; because we share in the priesthood of Christ himself, offering ourselves as living sacrifices by worshiping and serving God daily to help build his kingdom. &#x201C;A consecrated nation,&#x201D; because now Christians are set apart to live the new and everlasting covenant, called to be light and salt for the world. &#x201C;God&#x2019;s possession,&#x201D; because we have been united with Him in baptism, and serve Him alone as our Master, ready to proclaim the Good News of salvation available to all who believe.</p>\n<p>Our task today as believers is to Worship, Witness, and Work for Him who brought us from darkness into light.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Jesus is the cornerstone of this building we call Church, the People of God (CCC #756). Each of us participates, according to our own vocation, in Christ&#x2019;s mission as priest, prophet and king; we are therefore a holy priesthood (CCC #1546). Obedience is the hallmark of a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (CCC #709); are you being obedient to the successors of the apostles, the bishops?</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q472: How does one, like Philip or me, &#x201C;see Jesus&#x201D; and thereby &#x201C;see the Father&#x201D;? How can one do &#x201C;greater&#x201D; works that Jesus? (Jn 14:1-12)</strong></p>\n<p>These verses mark the beginning of Jesus&#x2019; &#x201C;farewell discourse&#x201D; in John&#x2019;s gospel. He is going away, but he will &#x201C;come back.&#x201D; It is this time &#x201C;in-between,&#x201D; as scholars call it, that Jesus is talking about.</p>\n<p>The foundational point is whether or not one believes in Jesus, believes in his &#x201C;name,&#x201D; in who he truly is &#x2013; the divine Son of God. Such a belief opens one&#x2019;s eyes to see that the Father and the Son are One. Jesus even uses &#x201C;imperative&#x201D; verbs to make his point &#x2013; and an imperative verb means it is a command. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be troubled&#x201D;; &#x201C;believe&#x201D;; &#x201C;have faith in me&#x201D;; etc.</p>\n<p>Once that belief becomes a reality in one&#x2019;s heart, a true relationship is established between the believer and Jesus. Now one can approach Jesus in faith, and not demand a sign. Now all that remains is to carry on the work of Jesus, but in the power of the Holy Spirit, not our own power. Precisely what is it that makes a believer&#x2019;s works &#x201C;greater&#x201D; than those of Jesus? As Fr. Francis Moloney says, the greatness comes from the very fact of his absence! Jesus is still present &#x2013; in his absence! And as the number of members of the believing Body of Christ increase, the works of Jesus increase proportionately, because now he can spread his word and works of love through millions of believers!</p>\n<p>Once again that puts the burden of responsibility on the believer. Are you in fact carrying on the mission of Jesus, by spreading his words and actions of love? Your answer determines whether or not you are in the proper relationship with Jesus. Because our journey is a pilgrim&#x2019;s progress, we can always make improvements in our relationships, can we not?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>For a Christian, believing in God cannot be separated from believing in the One he sent, his &#x201C;beloved Son&#x201D; &#x2013; the One to whom we are commanded to &#x201C;listen&#x201D; (CCC #151). Jesus is our model of holiness; he is the Way, the Truth and the Life (CCC #459).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>You Are A Royal Priesthood</strong></p>\n<p>Today&apos;s Gospel is part of Jesus&apos; farewell conversation with his disciples. They are confused and distressed at the prospect of his leaving, but Jesus comforts them and us with the promise of the Spirit. While he is leaving us in one way, he remains with us with us in different way, through the Spirit. The gift of the Spirit will build us into the Mystical Body of Chartist -- to be one with him and each other, to continue his mission in the world. The selection from Acts gives us a dramatic model of how the Spirit operates. Just as the Spirit enables the infant church to find a way for Greek speaking and Hebrew speaking Christians to live together in fellowship, so today the Spirit enables us to bring good out of unexpected and undesirable situations.</p>\n<p><em>Lord Jesus, you are with us and we are in you through the Holy Spirit. Help us to so transform ourselves that our lives may reveal your presence to others. </em></p> \n\t\t",

In the midst of it, Jim vowed \"If the Almighty God spares me in this war, I will become a Catholic! \"\n\nGod did spare him, and he kept his pledge. When mustered out of service, he went to work on a farm near Little Falls, N.Y., where he approached Father James Ludden of St. Mary's Church, Little Falls. Eventually received into the Church, he became an active Catholic; deeply religious and much given to reading and study of the faith. Between 1877 and 1885 he served as sexton of St. Mary's. At the age of 69, he retired to the Soldiers' Home at Bath.\n\nOur words of praise for the Catholic faith can often win others to join the Church. Even more persuasive than Catholic words, however, are Catholic deeds. It was the good deeds of the Sisters of Charity that moved Jim Loucks to become a Catholic. In today's gospel, Our Lord makes much the same point: \"Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else, believe because of the works I do.\"\n\nDoes our daily Christian life impress others to think well of our Church?\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q316: Why all the “new titles” for the early Christians in Peter’s epistle (1 Pt 2:4-9), and what do they mean for me today?**\n\nThe author uses the image of a “living stone” for Jesus Christ, discarded by the very ones he came to teach. Since they, the old covenant “builders,” have discarded the most important “stone” of all, the foundation stone, it now becomes their biggest stumbling block.\n\nOn the other hand, for those who do believe in Jesus and his word and works, as well as his identity as the Messiah and only Son of God, this “living stone” has immeasurable value. Because of their faith, believers receive four new “titles” that previously had been reserved for the Jewish people in the Old Covenant.\n\n“A chosen race,” because we have received the seal of the Spirit of God at our baptism. “A royal priesthood,” because we share in the priesthood of Christ himself, offering ourselves as living sacrifices by worshiping and serving God daily to help build his kingdom. “A consecrated nation,” because now Christians are set apart to live the new and everlasting covenant, called to be light and salt for the world. “God’s possession,” because we have been united with Him in baptism, and serve Him alone as our Master, ready to proclaim the Good News of salvation available to all who believe.\n\nOur task today as believers is to Worship, Witness, and Work for Him who brought us from darkness into light.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Jesus is the cornerstone of this building we call Church, the People of God (CCC #756). Each of us participates, according to our own vocation, in Christ’s mission as priest, prophet and king; we are therefore a holy priesthood (CCC #1546). Obedience is the hallmark of a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (CCC #709); are you being obedient to the successors of the apostles, the bishops?\n\n---\n\n**Q472: How does one, like Philip or me, “see Jesus” and thereby “see the Father”? How can one do “greater” works that Jesus? (Jn 14:1-12)**\n\nThese verses mark the beginning of Jesus’ “farewell discourse” in John’s gospel. He is going away, but he will “come back.” It is this time “in-between,” as scholars call it, that Jesus is talking about.\n\nThe foundational point is whether or not one believes in Jesus, believes in his “name,” in who he truly is – the divine Son of God. Such a belief opens one’s eyes to see that the Father and the Son are One. Jesus even uses “imperative” verbs to make his point – and an imperative verb means it is a command. “Don’t be troubled”; “believe”; “have faith in me”; etc.\n\nOnce that belief becomes a reality in one’s heart, a true relationship is established between the believer and Jesus. Now one can approach Jesus in faith, and not demand a sign. Now all that remains is to carry on the work of Jesus, but in the power of the Holy Spirit, not our own power. Precisely what is it that makes a believer’s works “greater” than those of Jesus? As Fr. Francis Moloney says, the greatness comes from the very fact of his absence! Jesus is still present – in his absence! And as the number of members of the believing Body of Christ increase, the works of Jesus increase proportionately, because now he can spread his word and works of love through millions of believers!\n\nOnce again that puts the burden of responsibility on the believer. Are you in fact carrying on the mission of Jesus, by spreading his words and actions of love? Your answer determines whether or not you are in the proper relationship with Jesus. Because our journey is a pilgrim’s progress, we can always make improvements in our relationships, can we not?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** For a Christian, believing in God cannot be separated from believing in the One he sent, his “beloved Son” – the One to whom we are commanded to “listen” (CCC #151). Jesus is our model of holiness; he is the Way, the Truth and the Life (CCC #459).\n\n---\n\n**You Are A Royal Priesthood**\n\nToday's Gospel is part of Jesus' farewell conversation with his disciples. They are confused and distressed at the prospect of his leaving, but Jesus comforts them and us with the promise of the Spirit. While he is leaving us in one way, he remains with us with us in different way, through the Spirit. The gift of the Spirit will build us into the Mystical Body of Chartist -- to be one with him and each other, to continue his mission in the world. The selection from Acts gives us a dramatic model of how the Spirit operates. Just as the Spirit enables the infant church to find a way for Greek speaking and Hebrew speaking Christians to live together in fellowship, so today the Spirit enables us to bring good out of unexpected and undesirable situations.\n\n_Lord Jesus, you are with us and we are in you through the Holy Spirit. Help us to so transform ourselves that our lives may reveal your presence to others._",

Joan was excommunicated as a heretic and burned to death at Rouen on May 30, 1431.

Here are some of the ideas he passed on to them.</p>\n<p>&quot;God is the creator of all men.&quot; &quot;There is the great God; does He hate anyone?&quot; &quot;The superior man exalts others and abases himself; he gives the first place to others and takes the last himself.&quot; &quot;The practice of right living is deemed the highest . . . complete virtue takes first place.&quot; &quot;Do not commence or abandon anything hastily.&quot; &quot;While his parents are alive, a son should not consider his wealth his own nor hold it for his use only.&quot; &quot;What you do not want done to yourself, do not do unto others.&quot; &quot;The body and the animal soul go downwards and the intelligent spirit is on high.&quot;</p>\n<p>These were wise sayings, indeed, and Confucius had many admiring pupils who carried on his work as a teacher. One of them, Mencius, who lived in the third century BC, was the author of one axiom that was particularly discerning: &quot;The great man is he who does not lose his child&apos;s heart.&quot;</p>\n<p>Try matching some of these statements with comparable passages in the Bible. Of course, not all that the Confucianists or the other thoughtful pagan philosophers said would blend with divine public revelation. But their efforts to teach goodness shows that God was calling them to Himself through the light of human reason, and they were listening.</p>\n<p>... I will place My law within them, and write it upon their hearts. (Jeremiah, 31:33. Today&apos;s first reading).</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>B209: Greeks come to &quot;see Jesus&quot; (= seek discipleship) and he talks about grains of wheat (Jn 12:20-33). Is there a connection?</strong></p>\n<p>Just a few days ago the Academy awards were hosted on TV, and those who watched were treated to the same annual &quot;display.&quot; Was the inner motive of the participants an anticipation of &quot;awards for achievement,&quot; or was it an annual disease of human striving for glory and attention through opulence and skimpy attire? Hero-worship or heroine-worship seems to be rampant, and God seems to be totally absent in a way that only Hollywood could bring about. &quot;SELF&quot; dominates the entire scene.</p>\n<p>We need to remember that we are approaching the end of the Lenten season, and that means that we are being led to the Cross. There is no room for &quot;Self&quot; at the Cross, only self-emptying. Jesus&apos; message is clear: if you want &quot;to produce fruit&quot; you must first &quot;die to self.&quot; It is only when the grain of wheat &quot;dies&quot; that it is transformed into an explosion of fruitfulness. This is what happened to Jesus; he freely accepted death on the Cross, fulfilling the will of his heavenly Father. And it is the Father that receives the glory, not the Hollywood heroes; glory belongs to God alone, not false idols. Discipleship demands this same self-emptying of pride and ostentation. It demands a choice either for or against Jesus.</p>\n<p>The call to &quot;lose our life&quot; is a call to conversion, to change from our present ways that keep us from full discipleship. We all hide behind a &quot;shell&quot; - our Hollywood veneer, so to speak - and it is that shell of false reality that must be cracked and surrendered to Jesus.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>We are specifically called by Jesus to &quot;take up our crosses&quot; and follow him (Matt 16:24-25; see CCC #618). When we do this, somehow we participate in a redemptive partnership with Christ. This cross of Jesus is the sign of our salvation, and makes kings of everyone reborn in baptism (CCC #786).</p>\n<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> what &quot;Hollywood shell&quot; have I surrounded myself with that needs to be surrendered to Jesus?</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q365: The metaphor of &quot;a grain of wheat&quot; in today&apos;s gospel is beautiful, describing how new life comes about (John 12:20-33). How can I apply it to my own life?</strong></p>\n<p>The metaphor that Jesus used has special meaning to those with &quot;green thumbs.&quot; For example, my wife Patricia and I love to grow tomatoes. During the harvest season, we save some of the seeds from the tomatoes, and put them in an air-tight container to save for planting the next season. In fact, the seeds can be saved for years. But they need to be planted, even though it be a few years later, in order to produce more tomatoes.</p>\n<p>Now, connect that &quot;seed&quot; metaphor with another part of today&apos;s gospel. Jesus says, &quot;where I am, there also will my servant be.&quot; Well, where is Jesus? In his public ministry, he is out there &quot;planting seeds&quot; of new life - seeds of love, seeds of instruction, seeds of our call to holiness, seeds of our call to faithfulness to God, seeds of forgiveness and compassion.</p>\n<p>&quot;There also will my servant be.&quot; As followers, as disciples of Christ, we are called to the same tasks that He engaged in. We are called to plant the seeds of Christ. This is what servants do: whatever their master wants them to do. So Lent is a good time to &quot;replay&quot; your recent life: have you been keeping your &quot;seeds of life&quot; sealed up for some unknown future use (also known as laziness and spiritual blindness), or have you been faithful in carrying on the mission of Jesus by planting those seeds in your daily life?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>An old proverb says, &quot;it is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness.&quot; It is easy to sit and complain about the world&apos;s immorality and decadence. But what seeds are you planting, what candle are you lighting, to help overcome this darkness and bring about new life? We need to continue the mission of Jesus, and live through Him, with Him and in Him (CCC #787). Mushrooms grow in the dark; Christians grow in the light of Christ and plant their seeds of new life by charity in action (CCC #1695).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>We Should Like to See Jesus</strong></p>\n<p>This is what the unknown group of Greeks asked in today&#x2019;s Gospel. Jesus seems to ignore the request; perhaps he knows that they want to see him only out of curiosity. As he said on another occasion, &#x201C;Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.&#x201D; There are a lot of people like that today. They want to know about Jesus out of curiosity; they devour books and TV &#x201C;documentaries&#x201D; about the historical Jesus. But Jesus didn&#x2019;t really ignore the Greeks in today&#x2019;s Gospel. He lets them and us know that we can see the real Jesus only in the context of the cross. Only then and through faith can we see the revelation of Jesus as the glorified Son of God. Jesus teaches us this paradoxical lesson: &#x201C;Whoever loses his life shall save it.&#x201D; and &#x201C;Unless the grain of wheat fall to earth and die, it remains just a grain of wheat, but if it dies, it produces much fruit.&#x201D; &#x201C;When I am lifted up, I shall draw everyone to myself.&#x201D; And he tells us, &#x201C;Whoever serves me must follow me.&#x201D; He tells us we must reject the wisdom that says, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s in it for me?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Take care of number one.&#x201D; Like him we must learn obedience and fidelity by suffering, by emptying ourselves, especially in service to others. It this dying to self that becomes our glory, just as Jesus by being lifted up from the earth on the cross draws people to himself and to the Father.</p>\n<p><em>Father, help us to be like Christ, your Son, who loved the world and died for our salvation. Change our self-focus into self-giving. Help us to transform even a little bit of the darkness and pain of the world into the life and joy of Easter.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

The older man, who was dying and aware of it, did not hesitate to share his wisdom with this new young friend. The most important thing, he advised, is to cling to the Mass at all costs. No matter how routine it could seem to be at times, he said, hold on to it and you will &quot;surely come out on the other side with certainty and peace of heart.&quot;</p>\n<p>After the war, Jackson entered the British diplomatic service and was eventually named the United Kingdom&apos;s ambassador to Uruguay. In 1971, during a guerrilla uprising by the Tupamaros, Ambassador Jackson was kidnapped, drugged, and locked into an underground prison. His captors held him there for nine months, with daily threats of death. Only lately has he set down on paper an account of how his faith sustained him before his release, and even enabled him to rise into a better self.</p>\n<p>During that long &quot;burial,&quot; he found by experience how much prayer helped him to remember that he was not alone. Now he recalled especially the counsel of his Middle East friend, long since dead, to &quot;cling to the Mass.&quot; He marked a calendar on the wall, and each Sunday in particular he &quot;attended&quot; Mass. Fondly picturing himself back in his parish church and recalling as well as he could the Mass prayers of priest and faithful, he went through the whole rite with devotion. When his captors finally agreed to give him a bible, that helped his &quot;Eucharistic celebration&quot; even more. Of course, he could not receive communion, to his deep regret. (Ever since those days he has found it unbearable to think that some people in the world are totally deprived of the Bread of Life year after year).

The older man, who was dying and aware of it, did not hesitate to share his wisdom with this new young friend. The most important thing, he advised, is to cling to the Mass at all costs. No matter how routine it could seem to be at times, he said, hold on to it and you will \"surely come out on the other side with certainty and peace of heart.\"\n\nAfter the war, Jackson entered the British diplomatic service and was eventually named the United Kingdom's ambassador to Uruguay. In 1971, during a guerrilla uprising by the Tupamaros, Ambassador Jackson was kidnapped, drugged, and locked into an underground prison. His captors held him there for nine months, with daily threats of death. Only lately has he set down on paper an account of how his faith sustained him before his release, and even enabled him to rise into a better self.\n\nDuring that long \"burial,\" he found by experience how much prayer helped him to remember that he was not alone. Now he recalled especially the counsel of his Middle East friend, long since dead, to \"cling to the Mass.\" He marked a calendar on the wall, and each Sunday in particular he \"attended\" Mass. Fondly picturing himself back in his parish church and recalling as well as he could the Mass prayers of priest and faithful, he went through the whole rite with devotion. When his captors finally agreed to give him a bible, that helped his \"Eucharistic celebration\" even more. Of course, he could not receive communion, to his deep regret. (Ever since those days he has found it unbearable to think that some people in the world are totally deprived of the Bread of Life year after year). The wonderful feature of these spiritual Masses was that he could be taking part in one of them right under the unsuspecting eyes of his masked jailers. Prayer, he concluded, is \"tyranny's enemy, the safeguard of its victim's mind and life.\"\n\nToday's special preface fits in with this story when it says \"Christ gives us the sacraments to lift us up to everlasting life.\" I am sure that since his release Geoffrey Jackson has often prayed in the spirit of today's final prayer: \"Almighty Father, by this sacrifice may we always remain one with your Son, Jesus Christ, whose body and blood we share, for He is Lord for ever and ever.\"\n\nMay his experience help us, who have no problem at all about attending Mass every Sunday and even every day, to better appreciate the Mass as a prayer that will carry us through to \"certainty and peace of heart.\"\n\n\\-Father Robert F.

She even experienced His bloody sweating. Constant meditation upon Jesus&apos; death won for her a sense of His constant presence; and while in these ecstasies she had many conversations with Him in a low, sweet voice.</p>\n<p>Now, the Church does not canonize people just because they are mysteriously marked with the wounds of the Passion.

Some think St. Paul may have been the first to receive this heavenly &quot;branding&quot;. At all events, Paul says (in today&apos;s second reading): &quot;I wish...to know how to share in His sufferings by being formed into the pattern of His death.&quot;</p>\n<p>Why so? Because it is only by uniting ourselves with Christ in His death that we can deserve to be united with Him in His resurrection. The whole paradox of Lent is &quot;dying in order to live.&quot; In that sense we can say that St. Gemma Galgani was Lent personified.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q572: Why did Jesus write on the ground with his finger (John 8:1-11)?</strong></p>\n<p>That has been one of the most fascinating actions by Jesus in all of the gospels, and draws many suggestions from movie makers and scripture scholars. Certainly the conclusion of the story is clear. The Pharisees were quick to test Jesus and point out that the Law condemns adultery with a punishment of stoning to death. Jesus confronts their selfrighteousness with a demand that they first examine their own consciences before they accuse another. After they depart in guilt like falling dominos, Jesus then forgives the adulteress and gives her another chance to amend her life.</p>\n<p>I am fascinated with the Carmelite suggestion that this action of writing on the ground is a possible allusion to Jeremiah 17:13 (RSV). That verse says that those who turn away from thee shall be written in the earth, for they have forsaken the Lord. Jesus is saying that he will not permit the Law to be manipulated by the Pharisees to condemn those they label as sinners, when the hypocritical condemners themselves are also sinners. Thus, just as the scribbling of Jesus that was written on the ground or in the sand will disappear with the wind and rain and be forgotten, so will the sins that God has forgiven disappear and be forgotten.</p>\n<p>Lent is all about self examination, to root out personal sin in our lives and to seek forgiveness. Significant among the virtues to reflect upon and imitate is that of mercy. Yes, we stand condemned under the law, because each one of us is a sinner. But we also know that we will be forgiven by God, to the extent that we seek absolution and resolve to amend our life. We can expect forgiveness from the Lord to the extent that we forgive those who trespass against us.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>The home is the first Christian school where one learns love and repeated forgiveness (CCC #1657), based on the loving mercy of God. The gates of forgiveness should always be open to anyone who turns away from sin. There is no sin, however serious, that the Church cannot forgive (CCC #982).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Turn to Me and Live</strong></p>\n<p>Today we hear Isaiah remind the exiled Jews of how God saved them in the Exodus, but he also promises a new Exodus that will make the original pale by contrast. Paul tells us that new Exodus is the death and resurrection of Jesus. I can be part of that new Exodus by following Christ in his suffering. We are already united with Christ but we are not finished; we must still run the race; we are called to deeper conversion, to more complete identification with him. It is like the woman caught in adultery. She was forgiven and given life, but she was commanded &quot;go and sin more.&quot; Like us she embarked on a life-long commitment to Christ.</p>\n<p><em>Jesus, reach out to help us remember that we live now not by our own power, but by the power of Christ living in us. Help us to take up their cross in our daily lives; guide us on our journey and bring us one day to share in your resurrection.</em></p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q572: Why did Jesus write on the ground with his finger (John 8:1-11)?**\n\nThat has been one of the most fascinating actions by Jesus in all of the gospels, and draws many suggestions from movie makers and scripture scholars. Certainly the conclusion of the story is clear. The Pharisees were quick to test Jesus and point out that the Law condemns adultery with a punishment of stoning to death. Jesus confronts their selfrighteousness with a demand that they first examine their own consciences before they accuse another. After they depart in guilt like falling dominos, Jesus then forgives the adulteress and gives her another chance to amend her life.\n\nI am fascinated with the Carmelite suggestion that this action of writing on the ground is a possible allusion to Jeremiah 17:13 (RSV). That verse says that those who turn away from thee shall be written in the earth, for they have forsaken the Lord. Jesus is saying that he will not permit the Law to be manipulated by the Pharisees to condemn those they label as sinners, when the hypocritical condemners themselves are also sinners. Thus, just as the scribbling of Jesus that was written on the ground or in the sand will disappear with the wind and rain and be forgotten, so will the sins that God has forgiven disappear and be forgotten.\n\nLent is all about self examination, to root out personal sin in our lives and to seek forgiveness. Significant among the virtues to reflect upon and imitate is that of mercy. Yes, we stand condemned under the law, because each one of us is a sinner. But we also know that we will be forgiven by God, to the extent that we seek absolution and resolve to amend our life. We can expect forgiveness from the Lord to the extent that we forgive those who trespass against us.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The home is the first Christian school where one learns love and repeated forgiveness (CCC #1657), based on the loving mercy of God. The gates of forgiveness should always be open to anyone who turns away from sin. There is no sin, however serious, that the Church cannot forgive (CCC #982).\n\n---\n\n**Turn to Me and Live**\n\nToday we hear Isaiah remind the exiled Jews of how God saved them in the Exodus, but he also promises a new Exodus that will make the original pale by contrast. Paul tells us that new Exodus is the death and resurrection of Jesus. I can be part of that new Exodus by following Christ in his suffering. We are already united with Christ but we are not finished; we must still run the race; we are called to deeper conversion, to more complete identification with him. It is like the woman caught in adultery. She was forgiven and given life, but she was commanded \"go and sin more.\" Like us she embarked on a life-long commitment to Christ.\n\n_Jesus, reach out to help us remember that we live now not by our own power, but by the power of Christ living in us. Help us to take up their cross in our daily lives; guide us on our journey and bring us one day to share in your resurrection._",

(This college is a religious residence for U.S. candidates for the diocesan priesthood.) Officials of the college invited many important personages to take part in the special Mass of Thanksgiving. The Vatican accepted the invitation to be represented; so did the U.S. government. Even more exciting was the fact that Belgium itself was to be represented by no less than the King and Queen, King Baudoin I and Queen Fabiola.</p>\n<p>Careful planning was necessary if all was to go off well - not only the reception and the dinner, but the Mass itself. The faculty planner of the liturgy, an excellent musician who appreciated church music past as well as present, announced to the students that although the Mass would, of course, be in English, the Congregation would be asked to sing the creed in Latin - the ancient Credo III in Gregorian chant.</p>\n<p>The students, still too young to have remembered the old Latin Mass, took a dim view of having a Latin Credo. They doubtless knew that recent popes had urged Catholics of all nations to learn at least the basics of the Latin Mass and its chant for special celebrations; but they assumed that liturgical Latin had lost its relevance by 1982. Of course, the faculty won, and all College participants were given copies of the Creed and taught how to sing it. It came surprisingly easy.</p>\n<p>As it turned out Credo III was a high point in the Mass. Not only the Italian papal delegate and the American staff and students sang it with feeling. Belgian-born King Baudoin and his Spanish-born Queen chimed in with the chant that evoked for them old memories. Furthermore, Mrs. George Schultz, the Catholic wife of the U. S. Secretary of State, also sang out the old familiar tune vigorously without even looking at the music.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is what we preach,&quot; says St. Paul today and &quot;this is what you believed&quot; (2nd reading). The Creed we pronounce at each Sunday Mass is truly a &quot;profession of faith&quot;. It states the main articles of Catholic belief. We can profess that belief in any language. But it is still nice to recite or sing it in Latin on occasion, especially at international gatherings. Latin remains a truly international tongue. Then are indeed fulfilled the psalmist&apos;s words, &quot;In the presence of the angels I will sing your praise ... All the kings of the earth shall give thanks ... when they hear the words of your mouth.&quot;</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>C253: Are today&apos;s stories from Isaiah 6, Luke 5, and 1 Corinthians 15 about religious vocations, or is there a different linkage?</strong></p>\n<p>Today we have three remarkable stories of universal vocations embedded in our readings. Each story either states explicitly or alludes to a three-step process. First, God makes his presence known to us. Second, we recognize our sinfulness in his presence. Third, we are prompted to take action.</p>\n<p>Isaiah sees the Lord and &quot;the burning ones&quot; (Seraphim); he recognizes his sinfulness (&quot;unclean lips&quot;) and is purified by heavenly fire (tongs, embers touch his lips). Peter knew he was in the presence of divine power when he saw the miraculous catch of fish that resulted from obeying Jesus, and he acknowledged his sinfulness to Jesus. Paul tells the Corinthians that the Risen Lord appeared to him last, and that appearance resulted in Paul&apos;s recognition of his own sinfulness in persecuting Christians.</p>\n<p>Then all three are prompted to take action. &quot;Who will I send&quot; said the Lord; &quot;send me,&quot; said Isaiah, and he becomes a great prophet. The Lord tells Peter that he will make him a fisher of men, and he leaves his fishing career and follows Jesus. Paul was given grace by the Lord to be the apostle to the Gentiles. All responded to this calling.</p>\n<p>The same Spirit of God that moved Isaiah, Peter and Paul to take action in serving God, now dwells within you and me, from our baptism. He is calling us to Holiness and offering us the means to attain it (the Sacraments). He is also calling us, the baptized, to continue His mission by spreading the Good News.

Thus the Christian faithful, now constituted as the People of God, share in Christ&apos;s priestly, prophetic and kingly office - and because of that fact, they are called to exercise the mission which God has entrusted to the Church (CCC #871). Lay Christians have the right and duty to work so that the divine message may be known throughout the world (CCC #900); this includes evangelization (#905). You are called to be the &quot;leaven of the world&quot; (CCC #940).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q566: Why did Peter feel so helpless and unworthy in the Gospel story today?</strong></p>\n<p>One cannot fail to see the connection between the First Reading (Isaiah 6:1-2a, 3-8) and the Gospel (Luke 5:1-11). One can feel so inadequate, like both Isaiah and Peter felt. However, obedience to the Lord always results in overflowing abundance. With the Lord, everything is possible. When he calls a person to discipleship, to follow him, there is no possibility of lacking anything to accomplish the purpose for which you are called by the Lord.</p>\n<p>Today&#x2019;s readings are really stories about responding to our own call to obedient faith, while we are still sinners. St. Paul speaks of the obedience of faith in the Book of Romans. The connection is that faith comes from hearing.

If you have rejected a call to assist, or if you have not recognized that it was really a call from the Lord, you can still make your present-day response a positive one, even though it has been delayed.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> All of us feel insignificant and inadequate to the task when faced with a call from the Lord (CCC 208). That is normal; but the next step is to say &#x2018;Yes&#x2019; to the Lord&#x2019;s invitation, like Peter in today&#x2019;s gospel and like Mary&#x2019;s response in the obedience of faith to the angel Gabriel (CCC 494).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Hear the Word of the Lord</strong></p>\n<p>Today&apos;s readings show us three men called by God to proclaim his message.

Our inadequacies and sinfulness seem to loom all the larger. But the mission is not dependent on our worthiness but on God&apos;s grace. We are all called to participate in the process of proclaiming God&apos;s word, but in a much less dramatic way than Paul and Peter. We are called to do this by the way we live our lives. While the faith tradition is handed down, it is preserved yet reshaped by the way it addresses the needs of the present time.</p>\n<p><em>Lord, give us the grace and the will to proclaim your word.

We are all called to participate in the process of proclaiming God's word, but in a much less dramatic way than Paul and Peter. We are called to do this by the way we live our lives. While the faith tradition is handed down, it is preserved yet reshaped by the way it addresses the needs of the present time.\n\n_Lord, give us the grace and the will to proclaim your word. Help us to live in ways that reflect our faith, lives full of self-giving concern for others._",

McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q. 317: Some so-called &#x201C;pro-abortion&#x201D; people claim to love Jesus. How can they favor abortion and make this claim?</strong></p>\n<p>Our gospel today (Jn 14:15-21) is very clear about &#x201C;who&#x201D; truly loves Jesus. Jesus himself says, &#x201C;He who obeys the commandments he has from me is the man who loves me.&#x201D; So a pro-abortion stance, in and of itself being directly in opposition to the Lord&#x2019;s commandments, nullifies any claim of true love of Jesus.</p>\n<p>Long before the officially approved &#x201C;canon&#x201D; of scripture was established, it was the constant teaching of the Church that abortion was a horrible violation of, and sin against, the commandments of God. For example &#x201C;The Didache&#x201D; &#x2013; aka &#x201C;Teaching of the Twelve Apostles&#x201D; &#x2013; was written in the first century (probably between 70-80 A.D.), and says the following, in part: &#x201C;Thou shalt not kill &#x2026; commit adultery &#x2026; commit fornication &#x2026; kill a child by abortion, neither shalt thou slay it when born&#x2026;&#x201D; Nevertheless, many pro-choice people claim a &#x201C;right&#x201D; to kill, abort, fornicate, adulterate, all actions which are in direct violation of both God&#x2019;s commandments and the constant teaching of the Church Magisterium (i.e., the teaching office of the true successors to the apostles). People with a &#x201C;pro-abortion&#x201D; stance are clearly giving more credence to man-made laws than they do to God&#x2019;s directives.</p>\n<p>Many times pro-choice people (each with their own definition of what &#x201C;pro-choice&#x201D; means) confuse their &#x201C;rights&#x201D; with their free-will &#x201C;choices.&#x201D; The &#x201C;pro-choice, anti-abortion&#x201D; reader must understand that it is the very idea that when they say it is okay for &#x201C;others&#x201D; to make that decision, they are directly and indirectly endorsing the evil effect on the community, their youth, and their own eternal life. The &#x201C;right&#x201D; to directly take an innocent human life belongs only to God. However, one can indeed make a free-will &#x201C;choice&#x201D; that selects an evil action instead of a loving action. If that negative choice is made and/or defended, then that person by the definition of Jesus himself in today&#x2019;s gospel is without love for being a willing participant in evil. Pro-abortion people claim to &#x201C;see&#x201D; the truth, but are &#x201C;blind&#x201D; like the Pharisees in John&#x2019;s gospel scenes. Jesus told them that since they claim to &#x201C;see,&#x201D; that their guilt remains (Jn 9:41, RSV).</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>People taking a pro-abortion stance are outside the communion of love and do not have the Spirit of Truth alive in their hearts (CCC#2615). Those claiming to love Jesus, but using abortion services, have replaced His Truth with their own ideals for their personal convenience. Even the simple bystanders, who have not properly informed their conscience, have replaced Truth with a gravely misguided altruism. Evil acts can be chosen deliberately, or by erroneous judgments and invincible ignorance (CCC#1790-93); nevertheless, true love proceeds from a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith (CCC#1794). Do not forget to intercede for those whose judgments appear to be faulty and lacking in love; by interceding we take our lesson from Jesus himself (CCC#2634).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q473: What does Jesus mean, &#x201C;I will not leave you orphans&#x201D;?</strong></p>\n<p>What consoling and comforting words we hear in the Gospel today (John 14:15-21). Jesus is about to ascend back to his Father in heaven. So Jesus tells his friends &#x2013; and therefore you and me &#x2013; &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry. You won&#x2019;t be orphans. I will be back in a little while. Trust in that. In the &#x201C;between time,&#x201D; the Father will send you another Advocate who will be with you always.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>What do you think occasioned those words from Jesus? Well, obviously the Apostles were a bit on the scared side! They probably were feeling exactly like teenagers going off to college &#x2013; scared to death, going off on their own for the first time, and fearing the unknown. So they receive the consolation and affirmation and support of their parents. Jesus is saying, as long as you have the Holy Spirit with you, you will have absolutely nothing to fear. So get out there and spread the Good News.</p>\n<p>Philip the Deacon worked mighty wonders (First Reading: Acts 8), but only because he was filled with the same Holy Spirit. In fact, his work of evangelization and healing was with the hated Samaritans, and the power of the Holy Spirit produced its results. Nevertheless, the bishops (the Apostles) had to come and &#x201C;lay hands&#x201D; upon these new Christians so that they could also receive the Holy Spirit.</p>\n<p>That is the message for us today. Never forget that the Holy Spirit dwells within you, not far away in some cosmic location! Baptism and Confirmation bring the fullness of the Holy Spirit into your life &#x2013; the same effect as if Jesus was walking with you and living in your house! That is a tremendous consolation, knowing we can call upon the Spirit of God within us in our time of need &#x2013; which is every day of our lives.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> The Father sends us the Holy Spirit because Jesus asks him to do so; this Spirit is the Advocate &#x2013; &#x201C;he who is called to one&#x2019;s side&#x201D; &#x2013; always there to lead us to all Truth (CCC #692). The gift of the Spirit imparted by the Sacrament of Confirmation perpetuates the grace of Pentecost in the Church (CCC #1288).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>I Will Not Leave You Orphans</strong></p>\n<p>Today&apos;s Gospel passage is part of Jesus&apos; farewell conversation with his disciples. They are confused and distressed at the prospect of his leaving them, but Jesus comforts them and us with the promise of the Spirit. While he is leaving in one way, he remains with us in a different way, through the Spirit. The gift of the spirit will build us into the Mystical Body of Christ -- to be one with him and with each other, in continuing the mission of Jesus in the world. The selection from Acts gives us a model of how the Spirit operates. Just as the Spirit enabled different groups in the infant church to live together in fellowship, so today the Spirit enables them not only top survive persecution, but to bring good out of it by planting the faith among the Samaritans.</p>\n<p><em>Lord Jesus, you are with us and we are in you through the Holy spirit.

A healthy branch of a fruit tree will do what it is intended to do: i.e., produce good fruit by being attached to a healthy tree.

Fruits must be seen to be of any use; they are never &#x201C;hidden&#x201D; on a branch, otherwise no one would benefit from their purpose in life. The &#x201C;fruit&#x201D; that Jesus wants to be seen in the life of every one of his disciples is Love. In fact, Jesus commands his followers to manifest this love at all times, and that love is expressed in the way they care for one another within the community. Real love naturally reproduces itself, reaching out to anyone who wants to share in the &#x201C;caring&#x201D; that is being offered. This is our purpose in life: to love, by first knowing, loving and serving our Creator, which in itself will impel us to know, love and serve others.

This week Jesus speaks more directly of that fruit, the fruit of love. Not the feel good self-indulgent love that TV commercials push, but a selfless, self-giving love -- the kind of love that God has shown for us, the kind of love that led Jesus to the cross for us. This kind of love doesn&apos;t come naturally or easily. We can get it only from Jesus who first loved us. We are called to recognize that love, to accept it and to share it. This is a love that is demanding and inconvenient. It may push us to our limits, revealing our weakness and our inability to love as he loves. So we pray, &quot;Lord, I do not love as I should; make up for my lack of love.</p>\n<p><em>God, our Father, in this great mystery of Easter you have made a new covenant of love with us; may this love which we profess with our lips be a reality in our lives.

And that is how we “remain on the tree” of life forever!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The Holy Spirit makes present the mystery of Christ, supremely in the Eucharist, in order to bring us into communion with God, that we may “bear much fruit” (CCC #737). We are the “sacrament” of the Church’s mission; i.e., our love makes present the mystery of the communion of the Holy Trinity (CCC #738). Can the world “see” the evidence of your sacrament?\n\n---\n\n**Love One Another as I Have Loved You**\n\nIn last week's readings Jesus spoke of our need to abide with him like branches on a vine and he demanded that the branches bear fruit. This week Jesus speaks more directly of that fruit, the fruit of love. Not the feel good self-indulgent love that TV commercials push, but a selfless, self-giving love -- the kind of love that God has shown for us, the kind of love that led Jesus to the cross for us. This kind of love doesn't come naturally or easily. We can get it only from Jesus who first loved us. We are called to recognize that love, to accept it and to share it. This is a love that is demanding and inconvenient. It may push us to our limits, revealing our weakness and our inability to love as he loves. So we pray, \"Lord, I do not love as I should; make up for my lack of love.\n\n_God, our Father, in this great mystery of Easter you have made a new covenant of love with us; may this love which we profess with our lips be a reality in our lives. Help us to love each other as you have loved us._",

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>The City Sparkled Like A Diamond.</strong></p>\n<p>We pray for the dead, &quot;May perpetual light shine upon them&quot;. Have you ever wondered what sort of light perpetual light would be?</p>\n<p>Soft and white, perhaps, like the light of a frosted bulb? Piercing, like the headlight of a motorcycle? Scary electric blue, like a flash of lightning? Too dazzling even to look at, like the glare of the summer sun? It might resemble any of these.</p>\n<p>But somehow I believe that the light in heaven will be more gracious. Today&apos;s second reading suggests what I mean. St. John had a preview of the &quot;new Jerusalem&quot; to be sent down by God. He says &quot;The city had the radiance of a precious jewel that sparkled like a diamond&quot;. In other words it shone with a glittering, amiable, transparent light. John used similar descriptions elsewhere in the Book of Revelations. &quot;The city was of pure gold, crystal clear.&quot; &quot;The streets of the city were of pure gold, transparent as glass.&quot; &quot;The floor around (God&apos;s) throne was like a sea of glass that was crystal clear.&quot; Centuries before St. John&apos;s day, the prophet Ezekiel had described the sky above God, whom he too saw in a vision, as shining &quot;like glittering crystal&quot;.</p>\n<p>From 1915 to 1917 the three children of Fatima, Portugal - Lucia, Francisco and Jacinta - had several visions of Our Lady and of angels. They, too, described the light in these visions as something you could see through. Lucia has recorded that the angel they saw in 1916 &quot;was a young man, about 14 or 15 years old, whiter than snow, transparent as crystal when the sun shines through it.&quot; And when Our Lady appeared to them on May 13, 1917, Lucy said &quot;she was more brilliant than the sun, and radiated with a light more clear and intense than a crystal glass filled with sparkling water when the rays of the burning sun shine through it.&quot;</p>\n<p>I think I would like that sort of light.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q267: The early Church seems to be embroiled in dissension less than one decade after the Resurrection of Jesus. Can the Holy Spirit really be at work in those circumstances?</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps the question could be rephrased this way: &#x201C;Is there a place for both controversy and peace in our Church?&#x201D; There are a lot of ways to nuance the meanings of &#x201C;dissension&#x201D; and &#x201C;debate,&#x201D; but the underlying thrust is the same: disagreement over a matter of importance, at least to the parties engaged in debate. The year is only about 49 or 50 AD when this occurred, which shows that lively arguments were arising whenever &#x201C;changes&#x201D; occurred that would alter or even threaten to modify &#x201C;established&#x201D; rituals and practices.</p>\n<p>The answer is a resounding &#x201C;YES.&#x201D; The Church grew and still grows in understanding its faith through lively discussions and debates among qualified theologians. Those discussions have been going on ever since the vision of St. Peter (Acts 10) which led to the baptism of the first Gentiles (Cornelius&#x2019; household), around 43 AD. It is important to recognize the wording of the Apostles&#x2019; decision regarding the waiver of the former discipline of circumcision: &#x201C;For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than&#x2026;necessary things&#x2026;&#x201D; (Acts 15:28). Clearly, the dietary laws, variations in certain rituals, and similar disciplines were deemed eligible for change as circumstances warranted.</p>\n<p>Every suggested change creates healthy discussions, and is preceded by healthy discussions. Closure is then brought to the discussion at some point in time, when the Apostles (or their successors, the united Bishops) reach a decision. Cultural conditioning plays a large part in some decisions (e.g., Paul insisting that women had to wear hats in church), as it does today &#x2013; also called matters of &#x201C;discipline.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!&#xA0; </strong>Perhaps it is better to leave the debates in the hands of the theologians, who are schooled in the ways of theological research (CCC #94), and who know the difference between debate and dissension. At some point in time, the Magisterium &#x2014; the official and recognized teaching office of the Catholic church &#x2014; reaches a decision on a subject, and to that decision we owe the obedience of faith (CCC#144, 85, 88) or assent of faith (optimally), or as a minimum the religious respect of intellect and will; and the Christian faithful are called upon &#x201C;to take care to avoid whatever is not in harmony with that teaching&#x201D; (Canon Law #752).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q423: Is the lesson from the First Reading (Acts 15:1-2, 22-29) intended to simply do away with the ritual of circumcision in the Christian community?</strong></p>\n<p>There is more involved in this Reading than the &#x201C;sign&#x201D; of the Old Covenant, circumcision. Elsewhere St. Paul has made his case that Abraham was justified (&#x201C;right with God&#x201D;) because he &#x201C;believed&#x201D; God before circumcision became a &#x201C;sign.&#x201D; Therefore, it was not right to force a ritual on newcomers (Gentiles) if &#x201C;belief&#x201D; is the first criterion of salvation.</p>\n<p>More importantly, we see that dissension within the Church over ancient rituals was resolved by taking the issue to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem. Their final decision has these important lines: &#x201C;Some&#x2026;without any instructions from us have upset you&#x2026; It is the decision of the Holy Spirit, and ours too, not to lay on you any burden beyond that which is strictly necessary&#x2026;&#x201D; Disciplines (not dogmas) can be changed by the proper authorities, as in this case.</p>\n<p>That decision was carried back to Antioch (the third largest city in the Roman Empire at that time) by two representatives of the Jerusalem Church, and accepted by the Church in Antioch. Later when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans (c. 70 A.D.), the official church center would move from Jerusalem to Rome.</p>\n<p>Clearly the authority of the apostles is evident in this decision of the &#x201C;Jerusalem Council&#x201D; - an authority that was later passed on to their successors, the bishops who were united with the Holy Father in Rome. The authority of the Magisterium (official teaching office of the Church) in matters of faith and morals comes from Christ (CCC #2033-37) and therefore demands the faithful preaching and teaching of God&apos;s truths.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> The New Covenant was sealed not with the blood of circumcision, but with the blood of Jesus Christ (CCC #610, 613). This and other dogmas are examples of the exercise of authority given to the Church Magisterium by Christ.

They came up with a compromise: the Gentiles had to follow some precepts of the Law but did not have to be circumcised and observe some of the Jewish food laws.

He shows me what I can do. But my enemy is also useful. He shows me what I should do.&quot;</p>\n<p>Never turn a deaf ear to a critic! God may be using him to tell us something.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q254: Jesus doesn&apos;t seem to leave any &quot;gray areas&quot; today: either you are rich and cursed, or poor and blessed (Lk 6:17, 20-26). Is it that simple?</strong></p>\n<p>Did you ever wonder how much of the actual discourse was left unsaid in Luke&apos;s final writing? Is the following scene the one that you picture? Everyone in the &quot;great crowd&quot; is seated. Jesus starts out by saying, &quot;Will all of you who are rich and want to be cursed, please stand up&#x2026; Okay, Woe to you guys&#x2026;&quot; Then he says, &quot;Will all of you who are poor and want to be blessed, please stand up&#x2026; Okay, Blessed are you guys&#x2026;&quot; No, I don&apos;t think it was like that at all!</p>\n<p>One of the keys to understanding is to find out what the gospel story tells us about God, and what that means for us now and in our future. There is no question that poverty and oppression &#x2013; real, physical poverty, and real hatred and persecution of Christians &#x2013; was a daily reality for Luke&apos;s community. Since that is true, the only way they could be called &quot;Blessed&quot; is because their loving God is right there in their midst, sharing in their suffering, no matter what their ordeal! If they keep their trust and dependence on Him, then their future is assured: eternal life with God, as well as peace of mind and heart in this life flowing from that dependent relationship. This is what gave martyrs their inner strength, as part of the fledgling community of Christians.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, those who trust only in their own wealth and power and social status are already engaged in self-condemnation. They have chosen to be dependent on &quot;things&quot;, the false idols upon which wayward individuals and entire cultures self-destruct. The &quot;Woes&quot; of which Jesus speaks are of their own making, because they have chosen to break the covenant of love with God and with His family.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Everything in moderation; and love for the poor is incompatible with immoderate love of riches or their selfish use (CCC #2445). The Lord grieves over the rich who find their consolation in their &quot;things&quot; rather than in Him (CCC #2547). This trust in God is a preparation for the blessedness of the poor (ibid). It is our attachment to things that can cause our self-destruction, not the ownership of those things.</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q410: Jesus comes down hard on the rich in today&apos;s gospel (Lk 6:17,20-26). Why is it so bad to be rich?</strong></p>\n<p>Jesus is not saying that it is &quot;always bad&quot; to be rich. He is simply observing what the acquisition of riches has done to the wealthy people of his own generation, and also to previous generations. Elsewhere he will talk about the difficulty of such people getting into the kingdom of heaven, like a camel trying to squeeze through a needle&apos;s eye.</p>\n<p>Our God has always been concerned about social justice - about seeing that everyone, especially the poor and marginalized, receives fair treatment, equal opportunities, and a reasonable share in the prosperity of a nation. Prophets sent by God have come down hard on those who had riches but neglected the needs of the poor. In the First Reading (Jer 17:5-8), God&apos;s prophet reveals the hearts of the selfish-rich. They have planted their roots in a barren desert, unable to yield good fruit - another way of saying they are trusting in their riches, and not in their stewardship of the providence of God.</p>\n<p>The poor and marginalized, on the other hand, plant their roots in a trusting relationship with God. They are the ones who are called &quot;blessed,&quot; because they have their priorities in order. A great reward is promised to them, because of their faithfulness to the Covenant, their faithfulness to Yahweh. Their hearts are open in love, not closed in selfish greed.</p>\n<p>&quot;Equality&quot; does not mean that everyone has the &quot;right&quot; to be a president of a corporation, or a top executive somewhere in society. Rather, it means the &quot;right&quot; to receive equal treatment, and to receive the basic necessities of life. This is what social justice is all about.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Are you willing to stand with those on the &quot;bottom of the heap&quot;? If not, which do you think pertains to you: the blessings or the woes? The Church&apos;s (our) love for the poor extends not only to material poverty but also to the many forms of cultural and religious poverty (CCC #2444).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q567: It is difficult to believe that being hated, poor, hungry, and crying can be good things, as the Gospel implies (Luke 6:17,20-26).</strong></p>\n<p>One of the things we need to keep in mind is the cultural attitude that was prevalent in Jesus&#x2019; time, all caused by an incomplete understanding of God&#x2019;s will. It was for the purpose of correcting these misunderstandings that Jesus spent so much time educating his disciples, and anyone else in the crowds who would really listen and ponder his words..</p>\n<p>For example, if a person was sick or poor in that culture, they were judged by everyone to be sinners who were being punished by God. After all, everything came from God&#x2014;or so they believed (cf. the Book of Job). If you were healthy and filthy rich, then surely it must be a result of God&#x2019;s favor and blessings to reward you for your good life. One exception to that train of thought seemed to be the greedy and brutal tyrant or foreign invader, who simply took what he wanted without any regard to God&#x2019;s desires or God&#x2019;s covenant people. But even those actions were usually construed to be a result of the nation&#x2019;s sinfulness.</p>\n<p>Jesus teaches us in today&#x2019;s Gospel that things such as accidental death, illness, and poverty are not directly willed by God. Instead, those very folks who seem to be condemned by God are actually esteemed and held in favor by Him if they have faith. In fact, just the opposite applies to the self-serving rich: they are really the ones whose actions are not held in high esteem by God.</p>\n<p>The message is simple, and both Jeremiah (First Reading: Jer 17:5-8) and Jesus are speaking prophetically. If your first preferential trust is in your wealth (possessions) or other humans, then you are really cursed (Jeremiah), not blessed. On the other hand, if you are a true disciple of Jesus and believe in the kingdom he came to proclaim, then your faith in the eternal future will transform your current hardships into a trusting anticipation of future joy.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Love for the poor is incompatible with immoderate love of riches or their selfish use (CCC #2445).</p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

Being a royalist by conviction, he resigned from the French Army and joined as a Major-General the insurgent army that battled the revolutionary government. When Napoleon Bonaparte became head of the revolutionary government, Joseph did not hesitate to conspire to assassinate him. On December 24, 1800, he and his fellow conspirators rigged up a cart full of explosives intended to kill Napoleon when he came by.

And this can happen only because of the promises of Christ. Jesus passed on the leadership of his Church to Peter, by giving him the &#x201C;Keys&#x201D; to the Church he promised to build.

Therefore, Christians have an obligation to renew their efforts daily to seek this &#x201C;oneness.&#x201D; Where do we start? Pray for that person you dislike.

Today&#x2019;s gospel shows Jesus praying fervently to his heavenly Father for unity among his disciples, and unity among those who come to believe because of the preaching and teaching of his disciples. Fr. Leslie Hoppe, OFM teaches that this experience by believers of the unity between Jesus and his Father impels the believer to spread the Good News of that love.

When he got into his car, one face appeared, and then a second. The two men forced themselves into the bishop&apos;s car and demanded money.

I don&#x2019;t think anyone would ever turn their back on someone really in need; it is in our very nature to give.

As they described it in Smithsonian, their craft &quot;Excalibur&quot; was a pretty sophisticated carrier; still it qualified as a row boat because it was propelled by oars and brawn. During the crossing the little boat was very much alone in the great ocean. The Savilles were pestered by the fear that Hurricane Arlene would come their way; and one day the Spanish freighter &quot;Atlantico&quot; almost ran them down.</p>\n<p>Though visually and spatially cut off from people, they kept human contact by radio. However, radio newscasts proved to be a mixed blessing. The solitude of the ocean had its charms: the &quot;wet desert&quot; was simple, fresh, and mercifully free of crime and violence. &quot;We listened,&quot; they said, &quot;to the BBC, the Voice of America - all sorts of stations. We heard when President Reagan was shot, when the Pope was shot, when the president of Bangladesh was assassinated - and sometimes wondered why we were rowing so hard to get back to civilization.&quot;</p>\n<p>At the Last Supper, Jesus prayed that His Father would protect his disciples. They belonged to the world no more than He Himself did, meaning the worldly world of injustice, cruelty, violence. Still, the people in the world had to hear the truth, so he had to leave the apostles among them. As ocean voyagers have to steer towards port despite the sea&apos;s enchantment, and astronauts have to return to earth from the stirring loneliness of space, so the Twelve had to leave the Upper Chamber and mingle again in a world of imperfect men. The important thing for all who have come close to God is that they not let the evil world again contaminate them.

As they described it in Smithsonian, their craft \"Excalibur\" was a pretty sophisticated carrier; still it qualified as a row boat because it was propelled by oars and brawn. During the crossing the little boat was very much alone in the great ocean. The Savilles were pestered by the fear that Hurricane Arlene would come their way; and one day the Spanish freighter \"Atlantico\" almost ran them down.\n\nThough visually and spatially cut off from people, they kept human contact by radio. However, radio newscasts proved to be a mixed blessing. The solitude of the ocean had its charms: the \"wet desert\" was simple, fresh, and mercifully free of crime and violence. \"We listened,\" they said, \"to the BBC, the Voice of America - all sorts of stations. We heard when President Reagan was shot, when the Pope was shot, when the president of Bangladesh was assassinated - and sometimes wondered why we were rowing so hard to get back to civilization.\"\n\nAt the Last Supper, Jesus prayed that His Father would protect his disciples. They belonged to the world no more than He Himself did, meaning the worldly world of injustice, cruelty, violence. Still, the people in the world had to hear the truth, so he had to leave the apostles among them. As ocean voyagers have to steer towards port despite the sea's enchantment, and astronauts have to return to earth from the stirring loneliness of space, so the Twelve had to leave the Upper Chamber and mingle again in a world of imperfect men. The important thing for all who have come close to God is that they not let the evil world again contaminate them. That is why Christ prayed for his messengers, \"I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to guard them from the evil one.\" (John 17:15. Today's gospel.)\n\n\\-Father Robert F.

The Lourdes physicians who examined him agreed that he was a physical wreck. Yet he insisted in being bathed several times in the miraculous spring. Two days before the pilgrims were to return to England, his legs moved during the bath; and during the Eucharistic blessing afterwards his nerveless arm came to life. He threw off the arm bandage and blessed himself. Next morning he suddenly awoke, jumped from his hospital bed and ran to the grotto in his nightshirt to give thanks. When the doctors examined him before he left on July 27, they recorded his as a remarkable recovery. Traynor himself was completely unaware of what had happened to him until his bishop gently explained to him on the pilgrimage train that he had been cured.

Each one of us knows someone in our circle of family and friends who is &quot;paralyzed&quot; because of sin and wrongdoing; that person needs you to hear God&apos;s healing word.</p>\n<p>Lest we forget, it was the faith of the four friends that caused Jesus to heal and restore the sick man to spiritual wholeness. The physical wholeness was a cure for the sake of the salvation of the doubters.

Are people stuck on their mats forever because of you?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!&#xA0; </strong>Jesus&apos; first concern is always the spiritual healing of each one of us. He intended that this ministry was continued through his apostles and their successors, when he said &quot;Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them&quot; (John 20:23) (CCC #1441-43). Do you make regular (at least monthly is recommended) use of the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession)? Jesus wants to heal us spiritually and physically (CCC #1421). Can you help &quot;lower others through the roof&quot; to enable this to happen? Do I realize that I cannot receive Holy Communion if I have committed a mortal sin (CCC #1457), but must first receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation?</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>&#x201C;I Am Doing Something New&#x201D;</strong></p>\n<p>The story of the paralytic and his friends is one of the more dramatic episodes in Mark&#x2019;s Gospel. Imagine the scene. Jesus is sitting there teaching the people in the crowded room and suddenly the thatched roof is torn apart and a man is lowered to the feet of Jesus. It is a classic example of overcoming obstacles, and Jesus, recognizing it as such, responds, but not the way they expect. Instead of saying, &#x201C;You are cured,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;Your sins are forgiven.&#x201D; That changes the whole point of the story. Of course, Jesus does cure the man, but the real question now is: &#x201C;Who is this Jesus?&#x201D; If he is just another wonder worker satisfying the need of the crowd for spectacular wonders, they can understand and deal with it. But to claim to forgive sins, and simply by his word instead of through the established rituals of atonement, that is something new. Thus the healing of the paralytic becomes a sign, a sign of Jesus&#x2019; primary mission -- to overcome sin, the alienation of human beings from God. This will be the greatest wonder of Jesus&#x2019; career, accomplished through the cross and resurrection. Mark reminds us that the grace we have from Jesus must show itself in how we live, in our efforts to know the will of God. In the Gospel we learn that eating Jesus&apos; body and drinking his blood is the way to share in his life and wisdom. As St. Paul tells us we ought to give thanks always and for everything we have received from Jesus our Lord. Giving thanks is exactly what the word &quot;Eucharist&quot; means.</p>\n<p><em>Dear Lord, give us the wisdom to know your will and sustain us in our efforts to become what you would have us be.

Mrs. Cynthia Fitzpatrick, aged 116, was about to be evicted because of over $1000 of unpaid taxes. It was not that the Rochester finance department officers were intentionally cruel. They were simply enforcing the local law, a law which made no exceptions for centenarians.</p>\n<p>An alerted public rallied to the cause. A black leader paid the tax installment immediately due; and Cynthia&apos;s minister set up a special fund to help Rochester&apos;s oldest citizen and the 56 year-old granddaughter who lived with her. Mrs. Fitzpatrick&apos;s response was one of deep faith: &quot;It&apos;s what the Master said: Take care of the widows and orphaned children. I can say people have played their part by me.&quot;</p>\n<p>I would have expected her to comment thus. I had first encountered this deeply spiritual black woman in 1976. When the floating New York State museum called the &quot;Bicentennial Barge&quot; docked at Rochester on September 4, a Lutheran minister and I were invited to say a brief prayer at the local opening. The ribbon-cutting was reserved for a black senior citizen whom I had never met. &quot;That&apos;s Cynthia Fitzpatrick,&quot; a bystander whispered to me. &quot;She was born in 1864 in Mississippi of slave stock.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cynthia wore a long, attractive dress and a picture hat. She was a woman of smiling countenance and great dignity. When her moment came, she approached the gangplank, her arm linked with that of a friend. The crowd was silent as she took the scissors. Her speech was brief, but she said all that was needed to transform a patriotic event into a spiritual moment. &quot;In the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, I cut this ribbon.&quot;</p>\n<p>...Whatever you do, you should do all for the glory of God.

Surely that would have been a great witness to his divine power?</strong></p>\n<p>Because of his healing ministry, Jesus was fast becoming a &quot;celebrity&quot; to such an extent that he suffered from one of the same problems with which the Hollywood stars have to cope. They are like a magnet, drawing people to themselves - fans, admirers, sensation seekers, and people trying to make a fast buck (e.g., the paparazzi - journalists who hound famous people incessantly). This constant invasion of privacy drives the celebrities into hiding, since they cannot live a &quot;normal&quot; life without being surrounded continuously.</p>\n<p>For this same reason, Jesus would warn those he healed to &quot;tell no one,&quot; because fame from these actions would impede his movements. He had a mission to carry out and Good News to proclaim, and a very short time in which to do that. So we read about his rising before dawn to avoid the crowds, in order to find desert solitude and space to pray (last Sunday&apos;s gospel); or he would go up into the mountains to pray. Many times he and the apostles would try to &quot;escape&quot; from the crowd by leaving in a boat.</p>\n<p>Jesus&apos; healing mission always had one goal: to restore the &quot;unclean&quot; and isolated person back to his community, which would also be a witness to the glory of his Father. He did not want the sick person to be ignored and avoided by his friends and family simply because they had a problem. No one is an outcast around Jesus, not even the leper!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Do you find friends and neighbors avoiding you when you or a family member become seriously ill? If so, you are sharing in the suffering of the outcasts. We need to remember that the Church continues the healing mission of Jesus, and offers special healing prayers called the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick for those with serious illnesses (CCC #1509-10). This Sacrament is offered to parishioners at any time of serious illness, and especially when they are in danger of death from sickness or old age (CCC #1514). Call your parish priest, who is the proper minister of this great Sacrament (CCC #1516), and celebrate it with your family present (CCC #1517). There are many important graces received through this Sacrament (CCC #1520-22), including the compassion of the believing community.</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Moved with Compassion, He Stretched out His Hand and Touched Him</strong></p>\n<p>Jesus does the impossible; he cures a leper and then asks the impossible --don&apos;t tell anyone! Jesus did not want to be known chiefly as a wonder worker; he didn&apos;t want us to get the idea that miracles were at our beck and call. This leper appealed to Jesus&apos; compassion, and Jesus, moved with compassion, reached out and touched the leper. He bonded with the leper, risking contagion and incurring ritual impurity. From the moment he touched the leper, Jesus was considered unclean and prohibited from entering the temple or synagogue or taking part in any liturgical worship of the Father. That was the price he had to pay for his act of compassion &#x2013; certainly far less than the price he paid later on Calvary for his compassion towards all of us. This is the example that Paul followed and urged on the Corinthians: &quot;What ever you do may it be done for the glory of God.&quot;&#xA0; &quot;Be imitators of me as I am of Christ, seeking not my own advantage, but that of the many.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Lord, we turn to you in time of trouble. Fill us with peace when our illnesses continue, with joy when we are cured, and salvation in the end. Rid us of everything that separates us from imitating your loving compassion.</em><br>\n\t&#xA0;</p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

So we read about his rising before dawn to avoid the crowds, in order to find desert solitude and space to pray (last Sunday's gospel); or he would go up into the mountains to pray. Many times he and the apostles would try to \"escape\" from the crowd by leaving in a boat.\n\nJesus' healing mission always had one goal: to restore the \"unclean\" and isolated person back to his community, which would also be a witness to the glory of his Father. He did not want the sick person to be ignored and avoided by his friends and family simply because they had a problem. No one is an outcast around Jesus, not even the leper!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Do you find friends and neighbors avoiding you when you or a family member become seriously ill? If so, you are sharing in the suffering of the outcasts. We need to remember that the Church continues the healing mission of Jesus, and offers special healing prayers called the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick for those with serious illnesses (CCC #1509-10). This Sacrament is offered to parishioners at any time of serious illness, and especially when they are in danger of death from sickness or old age (CCC #1514). Call your parish priest, who is the proper minister of this great Sacrament (CCC #1516), and celebrate it with your family present (CCC #1517). There are many important graces received through this Sacrament (CCC #1520-22), including the compassion of the believing community.\n\n---\n\n**Moved with Compassion, He Stretched out His Hand and Touched Him**\n\nJesus does the impossible; he cures a leper and then asks the impossible --don't tell anyone! Jesus did not want to be known chiefly as a wonder worker; he didn't want us to get the idea that miracles were at our beck and call. This leper appealed to Jesus' compassion, and Jesus, moved with compassion, reached out and touched the leper. He bonded with the leper, risking contagion and incurring ritual impurity. From the moment he touched the leper, Jesus was considered unclean and prohibited from entering the temple or synagogue or taking part in any liturgical worship of the Father. That was the price he had to pay for his act of compassion – certainly far less than the price he paid later on Calvary for his compassion towards all of us. This is the example that Paul followed and urged on the Corinthians: \"What ever you do may it be done for the glory of God.\"  \"Be imitators of me as I am of Christ, seeking not my own advantage, but that of the many.\"\n\n_Lord, we turn to you in time of trouble. Fill us with peace when our illnesses continue, with joy when we are cured, and salvation in the end. Rid us of everything that separates us from imitating your loving compassion._",

So why do I need to fast at all (Matt 2:18-22)?</strong></p>\n<p>If you are married, consider the days past when you were courting your future spouse. I suspect that you were very conscious of your appearance, so that it would not interfere with your dreams of a shared future. What about your spiritual &quot;appearance;&quot; do you let it interfere with your love affair with God, your future with him? If you permit such interference, then it will also affect your neighbors everywhere.</p>\n<p>Although they are certainly related, fasting doesn&apos;t have to do with &quot;too much&quot; as much as it has to do with &quot;too little&quot;! Too many times we are in &quot;denial&quot; of a problem called &quot;gluttony,&quot; both at the personal level and the national patriotic level. Lent is right around the corner, when people get serious about fasting, because we all know that we are the cause of &quot;too little.&quot;</p>\n<p>Consider: is my relationship with God &quot;too much&quot; or &apos;too little&quot;? That one is a no-brainer! Perhaps I need to discipline my body and my habits, including spiritual habits, so that I can tune back in to God. He is just waiting for me to do this, so that he can woo me in &quot;the desert,&quot; that place of solitude where he can speak to me of His love for me (First Reading, Hosea 2:16-17, 21-22). Consider the poor: do they have &quot;too much&quot; or &quot;too little&quot;? Another no-brainer! Fasting helps put me in touch with the real needs of those around me, as it moves me away from my selfishness and sharpens my perceptions of the privation of my neighbor. Consider our world: do we have &quot;too much&quot; peace or &quot;too little&quot;? (Wow, another no-brainer!) Fasting helps us convert our hearts, so that we seek solutions other than war and destruction.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!&#xA0; </strong>To begin your Lenten season, I suggest that you open your Catechism (please buy one, if you do not have one) and reflect on these two segments: CCC #1434-39, and CCC #2041-43. Remember that the greatest leaders in the world, including Jesus, fasted before they accomplished their great deeds.</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q360: Why did the Lord have to lead the Israelites &quot;into the desert&quot; (Hosea 2:16-22) to regain their love?</strong></p>\n<p>Remember when you first fell in love with your spouse? When that awareness hit home for me, just wanting to be in her presence almost became an obsession. I sacrificed everything that got in the way of being with my heart&apos;s desire. Family, friends, hobbies, special interests - all of those things took a back seat to my one and only desire: to be with the one I loved and with whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life. The longest impatient period of my life was the happy time of courtship, which I couldn&apos;t wait to see end so that there would be no more &quot;goodbyes.&quot; Yet paradoxically, time stood still when I was with my fianc&#xE9;e, and I did not want to see the day end which always meant a short time of parting. Forty-four years later there is no more parting; my spouse and I are one, we are committed, and we continue to grow in love for each other. But we each know others who have &quot;separated&quot; from their spouses, and then discovered their mistake. What followed was &quot;a new courtship&quot; on their part, to try to reconnect with their initial love that got sidetracked.</p>\n<p>Speaking metaphorically, God is like that: always wanting to be in our presence, exchanging love. God &quot;married&quot; his people, promising to remain faithful to them forever. But his people &quot;strayed&quot; and followed other interests and other gods. The Prophet Hosea&apos;s wife (Gomer) was a &quot;symbol&quot; of this unfaithful people; she left him and pursued other interests. But Hosea took her back, always faithful. In the same way, the one true God remains faithful, and always tries to woo his people back when they stray. His &quot;courtship&quot; with his Chosen People was in the desert exodus experience. Today&apos;s First Reading says that He will once again lead his people into &quot;the desert&quot; - a quiet place where they can be alone and grow in love again. What a forgiving and merciful God we have! What a lover!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Scholars tell us that the story of the desert wanderings in scripture always refers to a kind of encounter between humans and God. Later, the &quot;desert&quot; becomes a spiritual place where you meet God, especially in a crisis situation (such as sin). Lent starts soon, and God wants you to return to his full embrace. Aim for a full conversion of heart (CCC #1430) by opening yourself again to God and his people through a good confession (CCC #1455).</p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

So why do I need to fast at all (Matt 2:18-22)?**\n\nIf you are married, consider the days past when you were courting your future spouse. I suspect that you were very conscious of your appearance, so that it would not interfere with your dreams of a shared future. What about your spiritual \"appearance;\" do you let it interfere with your love affair with God, your future with him? If you permit such interference, then it will also affect your neighbors everywhere.\n\nAlthough they are certainly related, fasting doesn't have to do with \"too much\" as much as it has to do with \"too little\"! Too many times we are in \"denial\" of a problem called \"gluttony,\" both at the personal level and the national patriotic level. Lent is right around the corner, when people get serious about fasting, because we all know that we are the cause of \"too little.\"\n\nConsider: is my relationship with God \"too much\" or 'too little\"? That one is a no-brainer! Perhaps I need to discipline my body and my habits, including spiritual habits, so that I can tune back in to God. He is just waiting for me to do this, so that he can woo me in \"the desert,\" that place of solitude where he can speak to me of His love for me (First Reading, Hosea 2:16-17, 21-22). Consider the poor: do they have \"too much\" or \"too little\"? Another no-brainer! Fasting helps put me in touch with the real needs of those around me, as it moves me away from my selfishness and sharpens my perceptions of the privation of my neighbor. Consider our world: do we have \"too much\" peace or \"too little\"? (Wow, another no-brainer!) Fasting helps us convert our hearts, so that we seek solutions other than war and destruction.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** To begin your Lenten season, I suggest that you open your Catechism (please buy one, if you do not have one) and reflect on these two segments: CCC #1434-39, and CCC #2041-43. Remember that the greatest leaders in the world, including Jesus, fasted before they accomplished their great deeds.\n\n---\n\n**Q360: Why did the Lord have to lead the Israelites \"into the desert\" (Hosea 2:16-22) to regain their love?**\n\nRemember when you first fell in love with your spouse? When that awareness hit home for me, just wanting to be in her presence almost became an obsession. I sacrificed everything that got in the way of being with my heart's desire. Family, friends, hobbies, special interests - all of those things took a back seat to my one and only desire: to be with the one I loved and with whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life. The longest impatient period of my life was the happy time of courtship, which I couldn't wait to see end so that there would be no more \"goodbyes.\" Yet paradoxically, time stood still when I was with my fiancée, and I did not want to see the day end which always meant a short time of parting. Forty-four years later there is no more parting; my spouse and I are one, we are committed, and we continue to grow in love for each other. But we each know others who have \"separated\" from their spouses, and then discovered their mistake. What followed was \"a new courtship\" on their part, to try to reconnect with their initial love that got sidetracked.\n\nSpeaking metaphorically, God is like that: always wanting to be in our presence, exchanging love. God \"married\" his people, promising to remain faithful to them forever. But his people \"strayed\" and followed other interests and other gods. The Prophet Hosea's wife (Gomer) was a \"symbol\" of this unfaithful people; she left him and pursued other interests. But Hosea took her back, always faithful. In the same way, the one true God remains faithful, and always tries to woo his people back when they stray. His \"courtship\" with his Chosen People was in the desert exodus experience. Today's First Reading says that He will once again lead his people into \"the desert\" - a quiet place where they can be alone and grow in love again. What a forgiving and merciful God we have! What a lover!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Scholars tell us that the story of the desert wanderings in scripture always refers to a kind of encounter between humans and God. Later, the \"desert\" becomes a spiritual place where you meet God, especially in a crisis situation (such as sin). Lent starts soon, and God wants you to return to his full embrace. Aim for a full conversion of heart (CCC #1430) by opening yourself again to God and his people through a good confession (CCC #1455).",

Publicizing their virtues is thus a preliminary necessity. (Witness St. Therese of Lisieux, for example.) But men are more likely to have faced the public and won recognition by public good deeds.<br>\n\t&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Lay saints have been less frequently beatified or canonized simply because, unless they are martyrs, they are less known than nuns, than men, than bishops, than members of religious orders.</p>\n<p>You may notice, however, that the Church of late is trying to achieve a greater balance in accepting the causes of people of more diversified background. Today when Pope John Paul II visits some remote country, he may there bestow the title &quot;blessed&quot; or &quot;saint&quot; upon a holy person of that land. Also, a lay Native American, Kateri Tekakwitha, has been beatified; and a lay professor of law, Contardo Ferrini. This fact encourages bishops today to propose for sainthood diocesan priests like Msgr. Nelson Baker of Buffalo; reformed alcoholic laymen like Matt Talbot of Dublin; and liberated black slaves like Pierre Toussaint of New York.</p>\n<p>Of course, beatification and canonization are only certifications of the holiness of a few of the saints. The vast majority of God&apos;s saints in heaven will never be canonized because the Church on earth has insufficient evidence on which to base the certification. There are hosts of our own friends and kinsmen who are with God; and that is the basic definition of &quot;saint&quot;. Father Jean-Jacques Olier, founder of the Sulpician Fathers, even ventured the opinion that &quot;All Saints Day&quot;, which celebrated all holy human beings in heaven, canonized or not, is perhaps even greater than the feast of Easter since it honors God as perfectly united to his own human &quot;members&quot;. Through His Holy Spirit dwelling in them, those about His throne become his radiance.</p>\n<p>In early Eastern Christianity, there were already liturgical feasts in honor of &quot;all martyrs&quot; by the fourth and fifth centuries. In the West, a feast of All Saints was observed by the ninth century and it was already set on November 1. In England, &quot;All Saints&quot; was called &quot;All Hallows&quot;. The vigil before, consequently, was called &quot;Hallow Even&quot;, or &quot;Hallowe&apos;en&quot;. The liturgical vigil was abolished in 1955.</p>\n<p>Remember, then, not only to pray on each All Souls Day for the souls in purgatory of relatives and friends, but also to address your prayers on All Saints&apos; Day to your own saints, the baptized infants of your own families and acquaintances, and all your friends in heaven. Without telling you, of course, God has already swept hundreds of these up to Himself to share with them the eternal glory that He has promised to all the faithful. They will hear you in Him.</p>\n<p>--Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>(Update: Kateri Tekakwitha was canonized on October 21, 2012.)</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q552: John&#x2019;s epistle (1 John 3:1) says that right now we are &#x201C;children of God&#x201D; (tekna theou, in Greek). I thought that Jesus was God&#x2019;s only Son, as in John&#x2019;s gospel (John 1:14)?</strong></p>\n<p>This epistle&#x2019;s author can cause even more confusion, if one reads scripture only at the literal level. In 1 John 3:9 that follows, he says that God&#x2019;s &#x201C;seed&#x201D; (sperma, in Greek) remains in everyone begotten of God.</p>\n<p>John&#x2019;s gospel makes it clear that to be &#x201C;born of God&#x201D; refers only to those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God and rose from the dead. These believers are &#x201C;given authority&#x201D; (John 1:12-13) to be God&#x2019;s children.</p>\n<p>The author engages in a lot of metaphorical and figurative language, as above. But once in awhile he sheds light on what his meaning is, what his intention is. So in 1 John 2:29 he says by way of explanation, &#x201C;everyone who acts in justice&#x201D; or &#x201C;acts in righteousness&#x201D; is born of God or begotten by God (variations).</p>\n<p>The key to today&#x2019;s lesson in the Second Reading lies in the last sentence (1 John 3:3). It is the very fact that by faith we are God&#x2019;s children which gives us our hope. We need to strive for holiness, because He who &#x201C;begot&#x201D; us is holy. All of our efforts must be directed to praying for the grace to imitate Christ; to living the Christ-centered life by avoiding sin in all of its manifestations; and to seeking justice for those to whom it is denied. In effect, we are called to a radical change in lifestyle so that our lives will witness to the beatitudes taught by Jesus in today&#x2019;s gospel (Matthew 5:1-12a).</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> The Holy Spirit has enabled us to imitate the holiness of Christ (CCC #2345). The goal of our spiritual journey is to see God &#x201C;face to face&#x201D; in eternal life (CCC #163). What our faith confesses, the sacraments communicate: by the sacraments of rebirth, Christians have become &#x201C;children of God&#x201D; (CCC #1692).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>When the Saints Go Marching In, I Want To Be In That Number</strong><br>\n\tWho are these saints who go marching in? They are not just the canonized ones, notable for their heroic virtue.&#xA0; They are people from every race and social condition, the poor in spirit, the peace makers, those who hunger and thirst, those who give themselves in love for their neighbor.&#xA0; Their efforts, like ours, were not always perfect.&#xA0; Many of them, like us, stumbled and fell, but they asked for forgiveness and continued to work at it. So should we. Like them, we place our trust and hope in God, knowing that only by his grace and love can we be washed clean and join in their number.</p>\n<p><em>Jesus, risen from the grave, raise me up to new life with all the saints. Lord, we beg you to support us till the busy world is hushed and the fever of life is over and our work is done.&#xA0; In your mercy give us safe lodging, holy rest and peace at last.&#xA0; Give us the peace that we should give to others, the peace that the world cannot give. Give us patience and comfort and renewed commitment when we forget your ways and focus on our own.&#xA0; Help us to follow the saints in doing your will</em></p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

Nelson Baker of Buffalo; reformed alcoholic laymen like Matt Talbot of Dublin; and liberated black slaves like Pierre Toussaint of New York.\n\nOf course, beatification and canonization are only certifications of the holiness of a few of the saints. The vast majority of God's saints in heaven will never be canonized because the Church on earth has insufficient evidence on which to base the certification. There are hosts of our own friends and kinsmen who are with God; and that is the basic definition of \"saint\". Father Jean-Jacques Olier, founder of the Sulpician Fathers, even ventured the opinion that \"All Saints Day\", which celebrated all holy human beings in heaven, canonized or not, is perhaps even greater than the feast of Easter since it honors God as perfectly united to his own human \"members\". Through His Holy Spirit dwelling in them, those about His throne become his radiance.\n\nIn early Eastern Christianity, there were already liturgical feasts in honor of \"all martyrs\" by the fourth and fifth centuries. In the West, a feast of All Saints was observed by the ninth century and it was already set on November 1. In England, \"All Saints\" was called \"All Hallows\". The vigil before, consequently, was called \"Hallow Even\", or \"Hallowe'en\". The liturgical vigil was abolished in 1955.\n\nRemember, then, not only to pray on each All Souls Day for the souls in purgatory of relatives and friends, but also to address your prayers on All Saints' Day to your own saints, the baptized infants of your own families and acquaintances, and all your friends in heaven. Without telling you, of course, God has already swept hundreds of these up to Himself to share with them the eternal glory that He has promised to all the faithful. They will hear you in Him.\n\n\\--Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n(Update: Kateri Tekakwitha was canonized on October 21, 2012.)\n\n---\n\n**Q552: John’s epistle (1 John 3:1) says that right now we are “children of God” (tekna theou, in Greek). I thought that Jesus was God’s only Son, as in John’s gospel (John 1:14)?**\n\nThis epistle’s author can cause even more confusion, if one reads scripture only at the literal level. In 1 John 3:9 that follows, he says that God’s “seed” (sperma, in Greek) remains in everyone begotten of God.\n\nJohn’s gospel makes it clear that to be “born of God” refers only to those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God and rose from the dead. These believers are “given authority” (John 1:12-13) to be God’s children.\n\nThe author engages in a lot of metaphorical and figurative language, as above. But once in awhile he sheds light on what his meaning is, what his intention is. So in 1 John 2:29 he says by way of explanation, “everyone who acts in justice” or “acts in righteousness” is born of God or begotten by God (variations).\n\nThe key to today’s lesson in the Second Reading lies in the last sentence (1 John 3:3). It is the very fact that by faith we are God’s children which gives us our hope. We need to strive for holiness, because He who “begot” us is holy. All of our efforts must be directed to praying for the grace to imitate Christ; to living the Christ-centered life by avoiding sin in all of its manifestations; and to seeking justice for those to whom it is denied. In effect, we are called to a radical change in lifestyle so that our lives will witness to the beatitudes taught by Jesus in today’s gospel (Matthew 5:1-12a).\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The Holy Spirit has enabled us to imitate the holiness of Christ (CCC #2345). The goal of our spiritual journey is to see God “face to face” in eternal life (CCC #163). What our faith confesses, the sacraments communicate: by the sacraments of rebirth, Christians have become “children of God” (CCC #1692).\n\n---\n\n**When the Saints Go Marching In, I Want To Be In That Number**  \nWho are these saints who go marching in? They are not just the canonized ones, notable for their heroic virtue.  They are people from every race and social condition, the poor in spirit, the peace makers, those who hunger and thirst, those who give themselves in love for their neighbor.  Their efforts, like ours, were not always perfect.  Many of them, like us, stumbled and fell, but they asked for forgiveness and continued to work at it. So should we. Like them, we place our trust and hope in God, knowing that only by his grace and love can we be washed clean and join in their number.\n\n_Jesus, risen from the grave, raise me up to new life with all the saints. Lord, we beg you to support us till the busy world is hushed and the fever of life is over and our work is done.  In your mercy give us safe lodging, holy rest and peace at last.  Give us the peace that we should give to others, the peace that the world cannot give. Give us patience and comfort and renewed commitment when we forget your ways and focus on our own.  Help us to follow the saints in doing your will_",

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>Q. 429: Why is John the Baptist&apos;s &#x201C;birth&#x201D; highlighted today (Luke 1:57-66, 80)? Surely his life events and his death are more significant than his birth?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it interesting that on Christmas day we think, &#x201C;Happy birthday, Jesus!&#x201D; In September once again we think, &#x201C;Happy birthday, Mary!&#x201D; But in June, do we think to say happy birthday to John, or do other &#x201C;vivid&#x201D; images of John crowd those greetings out of our mind? Yet, today is exactly what this Feast commemorates: the birth of one whom Jesus classified this way: &#x201C;of all the children born of women, there is no one greater than John.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In the Old Testament classes I teach, students occasionally encounter instances where a person&apos;s name is changed by God. The significance of a change in name is implicit and explicit: an encounter with God radically changes a person, immediately at that time and also as a life direction. Examples that you will recognize are: Abraham (from Abram); Israel (from Jacob); Rock (from Peter); and Paul (from Saul). Additional examples are found in today&apos;s readings. Isaiah is given his name from his mother&apos;s womb by the Lord, and John the Baptist is given a name by an angel that is different from the usual and traditional duplication of names (i.e., from father-to-son, or grandfather-to-grandson). Hebrew names were significant because oftentimes they expressed a religious belief, or were linked to an event that occurred at or near that time. For example, the names given the sons of the prophets Isaiah and Hosea expressed the content of their prophetic teaching. Even conquered kings were given different names by the stronger king, to reflect the new &#x201C;vassal&#x201D; relationship.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;John&#x201D; means &#x201C;Yahweh is gracious.&#x201D; What could be more gracious or grace-filled than the coming salvation event, graciously announced by the herald John the Baptist? It was a life-changing event that is singularly unique.

    "markdown": "**Q. 429: Why is John the Baptist's “birth” highlighted today (Luke 1:57-66, 80)? Surely his life events and his death are more significant than his birth?**\n\nI think it interesting that on Christmas day we think, “Happy birthday, Jesus!” In September once again we think, “Happy birthday, Mary!” But in June, do we think to say happy birthday to John, or do other “vivid” images of John crowd those greetings out of our mind? Yet, today is exactly what this Feast commemorates: the birth of one whom Jesus classified this way: “of all the children born of women, there is no one greater than John.”\n\nIn the Old Testament classes I teach, students occasionally encounter instances where a person's name is changed by God. The significance of a change in name is implicit and explicit: an encounter with God radically changes a person, immediately at that time and also as a life direction. Examples that you will recognize are: Abraham (from Abram); Israel (from Jacob); Rock (from Peter); and Paul (from Saul). Additional examples are found in today's readings. Isaiah is given his name from his mother's womb by the Lord, and John the Baptist is given a name by an angel that is different from the usual and traditional duplication of names (i.e., from father-to-son, or grandfather-to-grandson). Hebrew names were significant because oftentimes they expressed a religious belief, or were linked to an event that occurred at or near that time. For example, the names given the sons of the prophets Isaiah and Hosea expressed the content of their prophetic teaching. Even conquered kings were given different names by the stronger king, to reflect the new “vassal” relationship.\n\n“John” means “Yahweh is gracious.” What could be more gracious or grace-filled than the coming salvation event, graciously announced by the herald John the Baptist? It was a life-changing event that is singularly unique. For being faithful to his Calling, today we say gratefully, “Happy birthday, John!”\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The assumption of a new name at Baptism was common among early Christians, and continues to this day. It signifies both a devotional relationship to the person whose name is adopted, and more importantly, a radical change in the life of the person baptized. Baptism has effected the forgiveness of all original and actual sins, thus symbolizing the reality of turning away from a former life without Christ, to a life with Christ as sons of God (CCC #1214, 1213).\n\n---\n\n**Prepare the way of the Lord**\n\nThe prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah had been told by God that they had been called to serve God by preparing the way for the Lord's coming.

We see today that John the Baptist too was called from his mother's womb to this same task of preparing the way of the Lord. In our baptism we were also called to this task of preparing for the Lord to come to the people we encounter in our lives.\n\n_Lord God, our Father, give us the grace to \"preach the gospel at all times and when necessary use words.\"_",

God also chose on occasion to work miracles through him. One feast day, all the boys in his &quot;Oratory&quot; school at Turin, Italy were scheduled to receive Holy Communion from him at Mass. When Communion time came, however, he opened the ciborium containing the sacred hosts and found it almost empty. And 650 students were lined up to receive! (The sacristan of the Chapel almost fainted when he saw the surprised look of the Saint as he took the cover off the ciborium. Father Sacristan had completely forgotten to put out another ciborium filled with altar breads to be consecrated during that Mass!)</p>\n<p>Don Bosco paused only a moment. Then he lifted his eyes to heaven, breathed a little prayer, grasped the ciborium and started to administer Communion to the kneeling boys. Marvel upon marvels, each time he removed a host, another appeared to replace it. Thus, there were enough to take care of 650 students, and probably some left besides.</p>\n<p>Naturally, this miraculous multiplication could not be kept quiet at the Oratory. His associates asked St. John about it, and he agreed that something remarkable had occurred.</p>\n<p>&quot;God is good&quot; he said, &quot;and He saw to it that the boys were taken care of.&quot; Today we celebrate Corpus Christi - the Church&apos;s special feast in honor of the Eucharistic Body and Blood of Christ. Appropriately, the gospel chosen relates Jesus&apos; feeding the 5000 by multiplying the loaves and fishes. It was a miracle clearly foreshadowing the institution of the Eucharist. Our Lord has not often been called upon to multiply already consecrated hosts, as He did for Don Bosco. It is almost a miracle in itself that at every Mass in the world since Holy Thursday Christ has multiplied Himself as Eucharistic food.

    "markdown": "**They Had Enough**\n\nSt. John Bosco (1815-1888), better known as \"Don Bosco\", was not only a skilled administrator, missionary and eucator of boys. God also chose on occasion to work miracles through him. One feast day, all the boys in his \"Oratory\" school at Turin, Italy were scheduled to receive Holy Communion from him at Mass. When Communion time came, however, he opened the ciborium containing the sacred hosts and found it almost empty. And 650 students were lined up to receive! (The sacristan of the Chapel almost fainted when he saw the surprised look of the Saint as he took the cover off the ciborium. Father Sacristan had completely forgotten to put out another ciborium filled with altar breads to be consecrated during that Mass!)\n\nDon Bosco paused only a moment. Then he lifted his eyes to heaven, breathed a little prayer, grasped the ciborium and started to administer Communion to the kneeling boys. Marvel upon marvels, each time he removed a host, another appeared to replace it. Thus, there were enough to take care of 650 students, and probably some left besides.\n\nNaturally, this miraculous multiplication could not be kept quiet at the Oratory. His associates asked St. John about it, and he agreed that something remarkable had occurred.\n\n\"God is good\" he said, \"and He saw to it that the boys were taken care of.\" Today we celebrate Corpus Christi - the Church's special feast in honor of the Eucharistic Body and Blood of Christ. Appropriately, the gospel chosen relates Jesus' feeding the 5000 by multiplying the loaves and fishes. It was a miracle clearly foreshadowing the institution of the Eucharist. Our Lord has not often been called upon to multiply already consecrated hosts, as He did for Don Bosco. It is almost a miracle in itself that at every Mass in the world since Holy Thursday Christ has multiplied Himself as Eucharistic food. Thus the faithful, as today's gospel says, \"have all eaten until they had enough.\"\n\n\\-Father Robert F.

As head of this small constitutional monarchy, he was sufficiently harmless to be popular for a number of years. However, with the rise of Fascism in 1922, King Victor invited its founder, Benito Mussolini to become prime minister. The King&apos;s choice was not voluntary, but the only way he could prevent revolution and also save his own crown. Mussolini then made himself a dictator, meanwhile buttering up Victor Emmanuel after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1935 by declaring him emperor of that African country.</p>\n<p>The &quot;Duce&quot; joined Hitler&apos;s Germany in declaring war on the Allies in 1940 and 1941. When the Allies entered Italy in 1943, the King finally sided with Mussolini&apos;s enemies, ousting the Duce from office. But Victor had already lost face because of his tolerance of Mussolini; so he abdicated on May 9, 1946. He was succeeded by his son, Crown Prince Umberto, as King Umberto II. But only one month later, the citizens of Italy, in a national referendum, voted to change their government from a kingdom to a republic. Part of the new law provided that Umberto II, king for only a month, had to go into perpetual exile. So he as popularly dubbed &quot;the King of the May&quot; moved to Portugal.</p>\n<p>When Umberto, aged and ailing - and terribly lonesome for his native land - begged the Italian government to let him come home to die, he promised not to agitate for the restoration of the Italian monarchy.</p>\n<p>Before Italy could decide this plea - no longer the plea of a political schemer but of a homesick old man - Umberto died. But his case, even more than that of his father, illustrates the impermanence of earthly power.</p>\n<p>The kingship of Christ; on the other hand, is not earthly but heavenly. So as the prophet Daniel predicted, &quot;His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not be taken away. His kingship shall not be destroyed.&quot; (Daniel 7,14. Today&apos;s first reading.)</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q555: Are today&#x2019;s readings compatible? Jesus in chains, and Daniel&#x2019;s &#x201C;Son of man&#x201D; in heavenly glory?</strong></p>\n<p>How do you describe the indescribable? &#x201C;One like a Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven&#x201D; to stand before the Ancient One who has white hair, bright clothes, and a fiery throne &#x2014; this is the author-prophet&#x2019;s attempt to explain his dream vision (Daniel 7:9-14). The reality itself is simply that this is a judgment scene of human kings before the eternal throne of God and Christ the King, whose glory and power is so awesome that mere human kings and thrones are laughable. The descriptions also reveal a God who will not force humans beyond their capacity to understand. Or as the scholastic theologian Thomas Aquinas would say, &#x201C;grace builds on nature&#x201D; &#x2013; we can only understand a tiny bit and only when these divine things are described for us by inadequate human terms.</p>\n<p>There is a long tradition going back to the Early Church Fathers that this &#x201C;Son of man&#x201D; refers to the Messiah, especially since Jesus used that as a self-description many times. The implications are enormous for believers. Would you reject the everlasting, all-powerful and eternal kingdom of Jesus Christ, and choose to follow only an earthly king whose dominion and power is limited and will be judged? Does your daily behavior reflect your choice?</p>\n<p>This King Jesus and his kingdom are quiet unique. As he tells us (John 18:33b-37), his kingdom is not of this world. So we are called to trust, to believe, to have faith in the words of this Son of man we call Jesus. Those who did not believe rejected him and led him to the Cross.

    "markdown": "**His Kingship shall not be destroyed**\n\nVictor Emmanuel III became king of Italy in 1900. As head of this small constitutional monarchy, he was sufficiently harmless to be popular for a number of years. However, with the rise of Fascism in 1922, King Victor invited its founder, Benito Mussolini to become prime minister. The King's choice was not voluntary, but the only way he could prevent revolution and also save his own crown. Mussolini then made himself a dictator, meanwhile buttering up Victor Emmanuel after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1935 by declaring him emperor of that African country.\n\nThe \"Duce\" joined Hitler's Germany in declaring war on the Allies in 1940 and 1941. When the Allies entered Italy in 1943, the King finally sided with Mussolini's enemies, ousting the Duce from office. But Victor had already lost face because of his tolerance of Mussolini; so he abdicated on May 9, 1946. He was succeeded by his son, Crown Prince Umberto, as King Umberto II. But only one month later, the citizens of Italy, in a national referendum, voted to change their government from a kingdom to a republic. Part of the new law provided that Umberto II, king for only a month, had to go into perpetual exile. So he as popularly dubbed \"the King of the May\" moved to Portugal.\n\nWhen Umberto, aged and ailing - and terribly lonesome for his native land - begged the Italian government to let him come home to die, he promised not to agitate for the restoration of the Italian monarchy.\n\nBefore Italy could decide this plea - no longer the plea of a political schemer but of a homesick old man - Umberto died. But his case, even more than that of his father, illustrates the impermanence of earthly power.\n\nThe kingship of Christ; on the other hand, is not earthly but heavenly. So as the prophet Daniel predicted, \"His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not be taken away. His kingship shall not be destroyed.\" (Daniel 7,14. Today's first reading.)\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q555: Are today’s readings compatible? Jesus in chains, and Daniel’s “Son of man” in heavenly glory?**\n\nHow do you describe the indescribable? “One like a Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven” to stand before the Ancient One who has white hair, bright clothes, and a fiery throne — this is the author-prophet’s attempt to explain his dream vision (Daniel 7:9-14). The reality itself is simply that this is a judgment scene of human kings before the eternal throne of God and Christ the King, whose glory and power is so awesome that mere human kings and thrones are laughable. The descriptions also reveal a God who will not force humans beyond their capacity to understand. Or as the scholastic theologian Thomas Aquinas would say, “grace builds on nature” – we can only understand a tiny bit and only when these divine things are described for us by inadequate human terms.\n\nThere is a long tradition going back to the Early Church Fathers that this “Son of man” refers to the Messiah, especially since Jesus used that as a self-description many times. The implications are enormous for believers. Would you reject the everlasting, all-powerful and eternal kingdom of Jesus Christ, and choose to follow only an earthly king whose dominion and power is limited and will be judged? Does your daily behavior reflect your choice?\n\nThis King Jesus and his kingdom are quiet unique. As he tells us (John 18:33b-37), his kingdom is not of this world. So we are called to trust, to believe, to have faith in the words of this Son of man we call Jesus. Those who did not believe rejected him and led him to the Cross. As believers, we look forward with hope to the time when we will join him in his kingdom – and the only way to enter is to belong to the truth, to listen to his voice, believe, and act on his words. Even kingdom kids may be led to the cross!\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Jesus is the faithful witness who came to bear witness to the truth of God’s love. God is Truth itself, and for that reason we can abandon ourselves to Him in full trust and faithfulness to his word. To do otherwise is to accept the falsehoods of the tempter. (CCC 215,217) Do you read scripture daily to discover this Truth?\n\n---\n\n**Long Live the King**  \nThe Book of Daniel was written at a time when Israelites were suffering oppression and persecution by a powerful pagan king who insisted that all people must accept his ways or suffer painful consequences. Daniel compares this cruel and oppressive king with the just king God would send to free them and initiate a kingdom of peace and justice.

Instead of using power and might to impose his ways he gives himself over to ignominious suffering and death to rescue us from degradation and misery. We are called to follow Jesus by our own self-giving and love as he establishes this kingdom.\n\n_Lord Jesus, give us the courage and strength to give of ourselves as you gave yourself. Help us to know, love and serve you in all those we come into contact with. Help us to carry our cross to eternal glory and happiness with you._",

Does our manner of dress and our external behavior reflect our interior spirituality?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Like the Temple in purpose, our physical church is designed to be a privileged place of encounter with God, a house of prayer, not a place of commerce (CCC # 584). Jesus expressed the deepest respect for this special “place” of encounter with God; what is your attitude and behavior in your own house of prayer? (CCC #583)",

Alleluia!</p>\n<p>Renewal: if we are already baptized, we renew the promises we made at our baptism, to reject Satan and all of his works. By this renewal, we are asking for the power of Jesus&apos; resurrection to be made real once again in our own lives, to &quot;revive&quot; us from our ways of sin and darkness. We refresh our souls with the Sacrament of Reconciliation, and we gain strength for the journey by receiving Jesus in Holy Eucharist. We do all of this because we truly believe He is Risen! Alleluia!</p>\n<p>Mission: the Easter Candle symbolizes Christ, the Light of the World. That light has been passed to us at our Baptism, and now we are commanded to carry on the mission of our Savior.

Alleluia!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Our faith must always grow after baptism, and for this reason we renew our baptism promises annually at Easter (CCC #1254). The baptized share in the common priesthood of all believers and are called to spread the Good News that Jesus brought to all humanity (CCC #1268).

Alleluia!</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q468: I find it very hard to believe that three people&#x2019;s experience of an empty tomb, formerly occupied by the body of Jesus, would lead them to Faith.</strong></p>\n<p>Faith is a gift from God; and the Gospel tells us that one person saw the empty tomb and believed (John 20:8); this was &#x201C;the disciple that Jesus loved.&#x201D; But it isn&#x2019;t the disappearance of the body &#x2013; the empty tomb &#x2013; that moved the other disciples to believe in Jesus&#x2019; resurrection. I&#x2019;m sure that Mary Magdalene and Peter had more questions than ever before, when they saw that empty tomb. It was only when they and many other disciples actually saw the Risen Christ, that they were moved to true belief.</p>\n<p>So initially their earliest preaching was in the form of &#x201C;kerygma,&#x201D; a simple proclamation of the essential elements of their belief. Those elements were the fact that they were indeed Witnesses &#x2013; they had actually seen Jesus die, and also had seen the Risen Jesus; he is the long-awaited Messiah; in fact, this Messiah fulfilled the words of the prophets; and he calls us all to believe, repent, and receive forgiveness of our sins. One of the earliest examples of this early kerygma or basic preaching is found in the First Reading today (Acts 10:34a, 37-43). All of these elements of kerygma are found in that proclamation.</p>\n<p>Christian faith in the resurrection has always been a stumbling block for non-believers. Greek and Roman philosophy (and other oriental religions) accepted some form of spirit life after death, but never did they expect to hear lots of people claiming to have witnessed a resurrected body (for an example of this, remember St. Paul&#x2019;s experiences in Athens, Acts 17:32). To believe in the resurrection of Jesus means that we also believe in our own resurrection &#x2013; just as Jesus promised us.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>In death, which is the separation of the soul from the body, the human body decays and the soul goes to meet God, while awaiting its reunion with its glorified body (CCC #997). &#x201C;How&#x201D; this comes about exceeds our imagination and understanding; it is accessible only to faith (CCC #1000).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>This is the Day the Lord has Made, Let Us Rejoice and be Glad</strong></p>\n<p>Easter is the pivotal day in the Christian calendar. The Paschal Mystery of the life death and resurrection of the Lord, is the heart of Christian faith.

Eventually they all came to be witnesses of the resurrection, but they had much to learn and appreciate about the Lord. As St. Paul tells the Corinthians, by baptism we participate in Christ&apos;s life, death and resurrection and it can and should shape our lives and give us spiritual energy. We too have to be enlightened and strengthened by the Holy spirit to recognize the power of the risen Jesus in our lives. We are still on earth but we have to live with the new risen life that Christ shares with us. To the extent that we do this, people will sense and experience the meaning of the resurrection of the Lord.</p>\n<p><em>Come, Holy Spirit, and help us to shape our lives so that we may truly be an Easter People.

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>Kings shall pay him homage</strong></p>\n<p>Christian tradition has made three Kings out of the three Wise Men. Whether they were royal is not important; but it would certainly have been appropriate for the first Gentiles who were invited to greet the infant King of Kings, to have been of kingly state.</p>\n<p>King St. Louis IX of France became a sort of fourth Wise Man when he devoutly visited the shrines of the Holy Land around the year 1250. Those were the days of the crusades - armed Christian expeditions against the Moslems of Palestine who had seized Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and the other places of pilgrimage made holy by Christ&apos;s presence. As a young king, Louis followed the crusade movement with great devotion. In 1239, he accepted as a most precious gift the crown of thorns of Christ, given to him by the French crusader, Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople. To house this crown of thorns King Louis built a beautiful little church that still stands in Paris, &quot;La Sainte Chappelle.&quot;</p>\n<p>In 1244, St. Louis was gravely ill. Blessed with the relic of the sacred crown of Christ, he suddenly recovered. In thanks, he vowed to head a new crusade to the Holy Land, where the Moslems were threatening to recoup their losses. Louis landed in Egypt and set out against the enemy. &quot;Never did any one behold so fine a man,&quot; one of his officers said. &quot;He appeared towering over all his people, head and shoulders taller than they, a gilded helmet on his head, a German sword in his hand.&quot; A truly royal figure!</p>\n<p>Actually, Louis&apos; campaign failed. He was himself captured, then ransomed. But he was nevertheless able to make his way as a pilgrim to Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Thus he fulfilled the dream of the psalmist: &quot;Let us go where He is waiting and worship at His footstool&quot; (Ps. 132, 7)...&quot;All kings shall pay Him homage, all nations shall serve Him&quot; (Ps. 72, 11. Today&apos;s responsorial psalm.)</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q353: There is a lot of talk about &#x201C;light&#x201D; and &#x201C;glory&#x201D; and &#x201C;stars&#x201D; in today&#x2019;s readings. Surely there is more going on here than just pious words?</strong></p>\n<p>Both the Old and the New Testaments are full of images that speak symbolically of the real presence of God. One image that looms especially large is the image of light. The &#x201C;pillar of fire&#x201D; that accompanied the Hebrews during the initial phases of the exodus journey, and the &#x201C;burning bush&#x201D; episode with Moses are two great examples from the Old Testament. In the New Testament, John&#x2019;s gospel is exceptional in its recognition of this &#x2018;light&#x2019; imagery as standing for God&#x2019;s presence, He whose &#x201C;light shines in the darkness&#x201D; (John 1).</p>\n<p>The nation of Israel had destroyed its relationship with Yahweh by falling away from the truth that there is One God, and that he commands his people to live their lives His way. Their &#x201C;darkness&#x201D; &#x2013; the sins of apostasy, idolatry and lack of a true spirituality &#x2013; eventually caused them to be led away into exile to Babylonia in 587 B.C. After seventy years during which they could ponder the real reason for their misfortunes, the prophet we refer to as &#x201C;Third Isaiah&#x201D; announced that their relationship with Yahweh was being restored: His light once more was being restored to the Israelites (Is 60:1-6). Once again they are called to be His servants, focused on God and not on the worldly allurements or distractions.</p>\n<p>The light theme continues into the gospel today (Matt 2:1-12), where we see a &#x201C;star&#x201D; shining in Bethlehem over the &#x201C;true light that shines in the darkness,&#x201D; the child Jesus. Here we find the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy from Third Isaiah that all nations would be drawn to this light. They will come to do homage and worship and praise the Lord, the One who will shepherd His people.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> On this celebration we call &#x201C;Epiphany,&#x201D; we celebrate the adoration of Jesus by those Magi drawn to the &#x201C;light of the world&#x201D; and guided to him by the &#x201C;light of a star&#x201D; (CCC #528). The long-awaited Messiah of the world has come. In the Holy Spirit, Christ fulfills the Old Testament symbols of light and glory (CCC #697). Are you focused on God first, or on worldly allurements &#x2013; i.e., does light or darkness govern your life?</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Nations Shall Walk by Your Light</strong></p>\n<p>All through their history the Israelites were ever conscious of their covenant relationship with God and of the promises God had made to Abraham, Moses and David. They were vividly aware that these promises had been fulfilled only in part -- due to Israel&apos;s infidelities. Isaiah today consoles them with the assurance that God is faithful, even when they are not. He describes in poetic language the future fulfillment of God&apos;s promises.

    "markdown": "**Kings shall pay him homage**\n\nChristian tradition has made three Kings out of the three Wise Men. Whether they were royal is not important; but it would certainly have been appropriate for the first Gentiles who were invited to greet the infant King of Kings, to have been of kingly state.\n\nKing St. Louis IX of France became a sort of fourth Wise Man when he devoutly visited the shrines of the Holy Land around the year 1250. Those were the days of the crusades - armed Christian expeditions against the Moslems of Palestine who had seized Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and the other places of pilgrimage made holy by Christ's presence. As a young king, Louis followed the crusade movement with great devotion. In 1239, he accepted as a most precious gift the crown of thorns of Christ, given to him by the French crusader, Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople. To house this crown of thorns King Louis built a beautiful little church that still stands in Paris, \"La Sainte Chappelle.\"\n\nIn 1244, St. Louis was gravely ill. Blessed with the relic of the sacred crown of Christ, he suddenly recovered. In thanks, he vowed to head a new crusade to the Holy Land, where the Moslems were threatening to recoup their losses. Louis landed in Egypt and set out against the enemy. \"Never did any one behold so fine a man,\" one of his officers said. \"He appeared towering over all his people, head and shoulders taller than they, a gilded helmet on his head, a German sword in his hand.\" A truly royal figure!\n\nActually, Louis' campaign failed. He was himself captured, then ransomed. But he was nevertheless able to make his way as a pilgrim to Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Thus he fulfilled the dream of the psalmist: \"Let us go where He is waiting and worship at His footstool\" (Ps. 132, 7)...\"All kings shall pay Him homage, all nations shall serve Him\" (Ps. 72, 11. Today's responsorial psalm.)\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q353: There is a lot of talk about “light” and “glory” and “stars” in today’s readings. Surely there is more going on here than just pious words?**\n\nBoth the Old and the New Testaments are full of images that speak symbolically of the real presence of God. One image that looms especially large is the image of light. The “pillar of fire” that accompanied the Hebrews during the initial phases of the exodus journey, and the “burning bush” episode with Moses are two great examples from the Old Testament. In the New Testament, John’s gospel is exceptional in its recognition of this ‘light’ imagery as standing for God’s presence, He whose “light shines in the darkness” (John 1).\n\nThe nation of Israel had destroyed its relationship with Yahweh by falling away from the truth that there is One God, and that he commands his people to live their lives His way. Their “darkness” – the sins of apostasy, idolatry and lack of a true spirituality – eventually caused them to be led away into exile to Babylonia in 587 B.C. After seventy years during which they could ponder the real reason for their misfortunes, the prophet we refer to as “Third Isaiah” announced that their relationship with Yahweh was being restored: His light once more was being restored to the Israelites (Is 60:1-6). Once again they are called to be His servants, focused on God and not on the worldly allurements or distractions.\n\nThe light theme continues into the gospel today (Matt 2:1-12), where we see a “star” shining in Bethlehem over the “true light that shines in the darkness,” the child Jesus. Here we find the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy from Third Isaiah that all nations would be drawn to this light. They will come to do homage and worship and praise the Lord, the One who will shepherd His people.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** On this celebration we call “Epiphany,” we celebrate the adoration of Jesus by those Magi drawn to the “light of the world” and guided to him by the “light of a star” (CCC #528). The long-awaited Messiah of the world has come. In the Holy Spirit, Christ fulfills the Old Testament symbols of light and glory (CCC #697). Are you focused on God first, or on worldly allurements – i.e., does light or darkness govern your life?\n\n---\n\n**Nations Shall Walk by Your Light**\n\nAll through their history the Israelites were ever conscious of their covenant relationship with God and of the promises God had made to Abraham, Moses and David. They were vividly aware that these promises had been fulfilled only in part -- due to Israel's infidelities. Isaiah today consoles them with the assurance that God is faithful, even when they are not. He describes in poetic language the future fulfillment of God's promises. Not only will they be reunited in the land of promise, but all the nations of the earth will see the glorious works of God. Then will be fulfilled the promise to Abraham that all nations will be blessed in his offspring and will come bringing gifts and praise for the wonderful work of god. St. Luke sees all these things coming beginning in the in the birth of Jesus. The Gentile Magi come bearing gifts and worshipping God. By baptism we share in the life of the Child of Bethlehem and so our lives should reflect the light that enables people to see the wonderful works of God.\n\n_God our Father, you led the wise men by the light of a star to worship your infant son, guide us by his teachings to a life reflecting to friends and strangers something of your promise fulfilled._",

How can that possibly relate to our lives today?</strong></p>\n<p>Christmas Day is a wonderful day for family gatherings. We really look forward to seeing the delight in the eyes of our children and grandchildren, as they enter the &quot;land of surprises.&quot; But after the presents are all unwrapped, memories are made and shared, and the family has feasted from a bountiful table, everyone has to go home - and &quot;the next day&quot; inevitably dawns. In our household that means the &quot;Discover bill&quot; comes, bringing us back to the &quot;land of reality and responsibility.&quot;</p>\n<p>We find that kind of situation in Matthew&apos;s gospel today (Mt 2:13-15,19-23). Like Joseph, we would all like &quot;yesterday&quot; to continue.

How can that possibly relate to our lives today?**\n\nChristmas Day is a wonderful day for family gatherings. We really look forward to seeing the delight in the eyes of our children and grandchildren, as they enter the \"land of surprises.\" But after the presents are all unwrapped, memories are made and shared, and the family has feasted from a bountiful table, everyone has to go home - and \"the next day\" inevitably dawns. In our household that means the \"Discover bill\" comes, bringing us back to the \"land of reality and responsibility.\"\n\nWe find that kind of situation in Matthew's gospel today (Mt 2:13-15,19-23). Like Joseph, we would all like \"yesterday\" to continue. We are joyful that the Messiah was born; we share the shepherds' delight in hearing and seeing this wondrous event; we kneel in awe at this incredible gift of the Incarnation; we just don't want the peace and joy to end. But it does end, and Joseph wakes up again in the \"land of reality and responsibility,\" a harsh reality that causes him to flee to Egypt to escape an evil plot by Herod.\n\nWe can learn a lot from Joseph and the Holy Family about responsible relationships, no matter what reality we are facing. This family knew that all authority comes from God (First Reading: Sirach 3:2-7,12-14) and calls for loving responses (2nd Reading: Colossians 3:12-17).

At its very center was Jesus who was Love incarnate.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q247: Why were Mary and Joseph so &quot;worried&quot; (Lk 2:48) about Jesus? After all, he was the Son of God, wasn&apos;t he?</strong></p>\n<p>There are various versions of scripture used to translate the Greek word which tries to show the concern expressed by Mary as &quot;greatly distressed&quot; (Interlinear), or having &quot;great anxiety&quot; (NAB), and looking for him &quot;anxiously&quot; (RSV). All of these words convey the concern of any parent over the apparent loss of an only child. In those days of kidnapping and sale into slavery of humans, the anguish would have been doubly evident. We need to remember that Jesus was human; Mary and Joseph were human; and therefore they would have experienced human emotions and normal human reactions.</p>\n<p>And yet the response of Jesus is puzzling. This puzzlement of both Mary and Joseph is captured in what we call the &quot;fifth Joyful mystery&quot; of the rosary, the &quot;Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple.&quot; Jesus, the boy, was indeed both divine and human; and yet he had to grow, like you and me, in his humanity. As scripture puts it, he returned home to Nazareth with them, and &quot;increased in wisdom&quot; (v. 52).</p>\n<p>We also need to take special note that Jesus lived under their &quot;complete authority&quot; (or, was &quot;obedient to them&quot; - NAB) when he returned to Nazareth (v. 51). Jesus spent his spiritual childhood under the total care and protection of Mary and Joseph. What does that say to you and me? Are we ready to live under the authority and protection of Mary and Joseph? Have I ever consecrated myself, and my family, to the Immaculate Heart of Mary?</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> The obedience of Jesus to his mother Mary and foster father Joseph is a virtue that needs to be learned by all children (CCC #2216-17). It also gives a lesson in obedience to all adult Christians, who need to submit their wills to all lawful authority, including the Magisterium (CCC #532), provided they are not issuing directives contrary to the demands of moral order (CCC #2242). We know nothing of the so-called &quot;hidden years&quot; of Jesus, from his babyhood until his public life, except for this one important incident when he was age 12. Could it be God&apos;s will that this revelation about &quot;authority&quot; was more important than any other event during those years (CCC #534)?</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q404: The Holy Family had some obvious &quot;advantages&quot; that we don&apos;t have. How can we possibly be like them?</strong></p>\n<p>Today&apos;s readings are rich in reflections on the ways we can enhance our family life. Do we not all agree that family life, family love, and family peace are great priorities?</p>\n<p>The first key to &quot;being like&quot; the characters in our readings today is to recognize that God is at the center of their lives, their reason for living. Once we grasp that fact, then we can orient our own lives in similar fashion: without Jesus at the center, our family life will deteriorate.</p>\n<p>A second &quot;key&quot; to watch for, the characteristic of unselfishness. Hannah (1st Rdg: 1 Sam 1:20-28) was a very prayerful woman. She prayed for a son, and fulfilled a promise to dedicate him to God. Her only son, yet she was willing to give him to God. There is a third &quot;key&quot; to watch for. Mary and Joseph (Gospel: Luke 2:41-52) were aware that the child Jesus was the Son of the Most High, the promised Messiah (Lk 1:32; Mt 1:21). Yet they could still be &quot;anxious&quot; for his safety. So they searched for him together.</p>\n<p>God-centered, unselfish, and always working together: three keys to imitate! Yes, we can be &quot;like&quot; the Holy Family and Hannah in these aspects of life, with the grace of God. So if our family life is not peaceful, loving, and burden-sharing, then we need to refocus on those keys to see what needs to change in our lives.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> Like Hannah, are you eager to help your son pursue a vocation as a priest (CCC #1578)? As a parent (or child), are you watching for those &quot;glimpses&quot; given to you that your own son must eventually &quot;be about his Father&apos;s work&quot; (CCC #534)? Are both of you, as parents, aware of your joint responsibility to nurture a vocation in your sons (CCC #2223-5)?</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Did You not Know that I Must be in My Father&apos;s House</strong></p>\n<p>Both Sirach and Colossians tells us how to live a life pleasing to God. They stress the community virtues, especially love which holds us all together in one body. Both apply this message to the relationships of parents and children.&#xA0; While the family is the context for learning God&apos;s ways, it is not an absolute. Obligations to God can supersede family obligations. In today&apos;s gospel we learn of the Holy Family&apos;s pilgrimage to Jerusalem. On the return trip they find Jesus is not in the caravan. On finding him teaching in the temple, Mary says,&quot; Why have you done this to us?&quot; His response &quot;Did you not know that I must be in my Father&apos;s house? &quot;Jesus does his Father&apos;s will but he does not deny his family obligations for he returns with them and was obedient to them.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Lord, help us to live like the Holy Family, united in respect and love. Teach us the sanctity of human love and the value of family life. Help us to live in peace with all. Help us to find you in the service of God as Mary and Joseph fond Jesus fulfilling his vocation in the temple.</em></p> \n\t\t\n\t\t<div id=\"navSub\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t",

This puzzlement of both Mary and Joseph is captured in what we call the \"fifth Joyful mystery\" of the rosary, the \"Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple.\" Jesus, the boy, was indeed both divine and human; and yet he had to grow, like you and me, in his humanity. As scripture puts it, he returned home to Nazareth with them, and \"increased in wisdom\" (v. 52).\n\nWe also need to take special note that Jesus lived under their \"complete authority\" (or, was \"obedient to them\" - NAB) when he returned to Nazareth (v. 51). Jesus spent his spiritual childhood under the total care and protection of Mary and Joseph. What does that say to you and me? Are we ready to live under the authority and protection of Mary and Joseph? Have I ever consecrated myself, and my family, to the Immaculate Heart of Mary?\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** The obedience of Jesus to his mother Mary and foster father Joseph is a virtue that needs to be learned by all children (CCC #2216-17). It also gives a lesson in obedience to all adult Christians, who need to submit their wills to all lawful authority, including the Magisterium (CCC #532), provided they are not issuing directives contrary to the demands of moral order (CCC #2242). We know nothing of the so-called \"hidden years\" of Jesus, from his babyhood until his public life, except for this one important incident when he was age 12. Could it be God's will that this revelation about \"authority\" was more important than any other event during those years (CCC #534)?\n\n---\n\n**Q404: The Holy Family had some obvious \"advantages\" that we don't have. How can we possibly be like them?**\n\nToday's readings are rich in reflections on the ways we can enhance our family life. Do we not all agree that family life, family love, and family peace are great priorities?\n\nThe first key to \"being like\" the characters in our readings today is to recognize that God is at the center of their lives, their reason for living. Once we grasp that fact, then we can orient our own lives in similar fashion: without Jesus at the center, our family life will deteriorate.\n\nA second \"key\" to watch for, the characteristic of unselfishness. Hannah (1st Rdg: 1 Sam 1:20-28) was a very prayerful woman. She prayed for a son, and fulfilled a promise to dedicate him to God. Her only son, yet she was willing to give him to God. There is a third \"key\" to watch for. Mary and Joseph (Gospel: Luke 2:41-52) were aware that the child Jesus was the Son of the Most High, the promised Messiah (Lk 1:32; Mt 1:21). Yet they could still be \"anxious\" for his safety. So they searched for him together.\n\nGod-centered, unselfish, and always working together: three keys to imitate! Yes, we can be \"like\" the Holy Family and Hannah in these aspects of life, with the grace of God. So if our family life is not peaceful, loving, and burden-sharing, then we need to refocus on those keys to see what needs to change in our lives.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Like Hannah, are you eager to help your son pursue a vocation as a priest (CCC #1578)? As a parent (or child), are you watching for those \"glimpses\" given to you that your own son must eventually \"be about his Father's work\" (CCC #534)? Are both of you, as parents, aware of your joint responsibility to nurture a vocation in your sons (CCC #2223-5)?\n\n---\n\n**Did You not Know that I Must be in My Father's House**\n\nBoth Sirach and Colossians tells us how to live a life pleasing to God. They stress the community virtues, especially love which holds us all together in one body. Both apply this message to the relationships of parents and children.  While the family is the context for learning God's ways, it is not an absolute. Obligations to God can supersede family obligations. In today's gospel we learn of the Holy Family's pilgrimage to Jerusalem. On the return trip they find Jesus is not in the caravan. On finding him teaching in the temple, Mary says,\" Why have you done this to us?\" His response \"Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house? \"Jesus does his Father's will but he does not deny his family obligations for he returns with them and was obedient to them.\"\n\n_Lord, help us to live like the Holy Family, united in respect and love. Teach us the sanctity of human love and the value of family life. Help us to live in peace with all. Help us to find you in the service of God as Mary and Joseph fond Jesus fulfilling his vocation in the temple._",

His father worked for the great meat-packing firm of Swift and Company.</p>\n<p>Andy&apos;s dad used every opportunity to educate his son along practical lines. One day when the boy was about ten, he took him on a tour of the Swift packing-houses in Newark to show him how they killed animals for the meat-markets. Swift called these places their &quot;abbatoirs.&quot; The French word abattoir sounds a little less gross, but it means the same as the English &quot;slaughter-house.&quot; What the butchers did there was a necessary but bloody business; not always easy for a visitor to stomach.</p>\n<p>Andy noticed in particular the way in which the different types of animals reacted to impending death. The beef cattle and calves struggled and bellowed with fear. Pigs squealed and squirmed and tried to escape. But the sheep were different. They simply stood there meek and silent, offering no resistance to their slayers.</p>\n<p>When Andy grew up, he became a priest.

His father worked for the great meat-packing firm of Swift and Company.\n\nAndy's dad used every opportunity to educate his son along practical lines. One day when the boy was about ten, he took him on a tour of the Swift packing-houses in Newark to show him how they killed animals for the meat-markets. Swift called these places their \"abbatoirs.\" The French word abattoir sounds a little less gross, but it means the same as the English \"slaughter-house.\" What the butchers did there was a necessary but bloody business; not always easy for a visitor to stomach.\n\nAndy noticed in particular the way in which the different types of animals reacted to impending death. The beef cattle and calves struggled and bellowed with fear. Pigs squealed and squirmed and tried to escape. But the sheep were different. They simply stood there meek and silent, offering no resistance to their slayers.\n\nWhen Andy grew up, he became a priest.

    "rawHtml": "\n\t\t <p><strong>B210: Why did Jesus &quot;become obedient unto death&quot; (Second Reading: Phil 2:6-11)? And what does that have to do with me today?</strong></p>\n<p>There is a double answer, both of which say the same thing. First, it was God&apos;s will that Jesus accept his human condition in life, freely and fully. He not only chose to become man, he freely chose to offer himself, his very life, to redeem us from our sins. Secondly, this discloses something of his very mission. As you know, prophets like Elijah, Elisha, Jeremiah, and John the Baptist all suffered when they tried to bring Truth into the world. This was Jesus&apos; mission also: to spread the Good News, to teach truth and to be that truth.</p>\n<p>It is highly likely that any disciple who tries to bring truth to others will experience pain and rejection, just as their Master experienced pain and rejection.

And what does that have to do with me today?**\n\nThere is a double answer, both of which say the same thing. First, it was God's will that Jesus accept his human condition in life, freely and fully. He not only chose to become man, he freely chose to offer himself, his very life, to redeem us from our sins. Secondly, this discloses something of his very mission. As you know, prophets like Elijah, Elisha, Jeremiah, and John the Baptist all suffered when they tried to bring Truth into the world. This was Jesus' mission also: to spread the Good News, to teach truth and to be that truth.\n\nIt is highly likely that any disciple who tries to bring truth to others will experience pain and rejection, just as their Master experienced pain and rejection. Pope John Paul II wrote a magnificent encyclical entitled \"The Splendor of Truth\" which addressed the ways in which some theologians are distorting the truth, or trying to evade the truth with erroneous theories (called proportionalism and consequentialism) which would attempt to deny the existence of actions that are objectively evil under any and all circumstances.\n\nYou and I are also called to be \"obedient to the truth,\" and for us that means to accept the official teaching of the Magisterium in the area of faith and morals.

Ever since then, communication between nations has been difficult, and, at least partly for that reason, international peace has been hard to keep. Only once and briefly has God restored a single language to mankind.

When he addresses people who speak the world&apos;s major languages, he is able to speak those languages quite well. But he even seeks to learn at least a little of the more exotic tongues when he is about to visit some exotic countries. Thus he learned how to offer Mass in &quot;Pidgin English,&quot; that odd half-English language invented by European merchants in the South Pacific. When the Pope celebrated Mass at Papua-New Guinea in May, 1984, he said, for instance, &quot;Yumi Pre&quot; (&quot;Let us pray&quot;) and &quot;Bodi belong Kristus&quot; (&quot;Body of Christ&quot;).

He said he was sad to hear that Mollie Marie had since died, but he would never forget her loving gesture. And he assured the people of Alaska and the people of the whole United States that, even when he was far away from their shores, he would &quot;forget them not.&quot;</p>\n<p>We must wait until the resurrection of the dead before all human beings will once more be able to speak to each other in the same world-language. Meanwhile, however, whether we are gifted like the pope at learning the tongues of other nations, there is one international language that we can use even now, and that all men understand, because they read it in each other&apos;s eyes. It is the language that shy little Mollie Marie spoke when she handed the forget-me-nots to the Holy Father. It is the language of love.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F.

We can&#x2019;t seem to get our arms around such awesome happenings, things like &#x201C;tongues of fire&#x201D; on everyone present, Jesus&#x2019; surprise appearance through locked doors, and then a &#x201C;now it&#x2019;s your turn&#x201D; mandate to carry on his mission.</p>\n<p>Anytime we are reading about or experiencing supernatural events, we find ourselves in the presence of &#x201C;mystery.&#x201D; It is not for us to understand the &#x201C;how&#x201D;; rather, it is for us to believe that all of this fits into God&#x2019;s plan of salvation. That means that we simply Trust him, listen to him, and follow his commands.</p>\n<p>John&#x2019;s gospel (Jn 20:19-23) packs a powerful punch in only a few words. We could paraphrase them like this: &#x201C;I give you Peace; I give you the Holy Spirit; I send you to do my work; You will be forgiving and compassionate like me.&#x201D; All of that sounds like a &#x201C;graduation&#x201D; speech for a small bunch of folks behind locked doors, probably scared out of their wits that they might receive the same treatment as Jesus, and not knowing what to do next.</p>\n<p>The beauty of Pentecost is the reminder that we have the Holy Spirit within us, as a very precious gift of God. Baptism and Confirmation empower us with a fullness of the Spirit that is sufficient to carry out our part in God&#x2019;s plan of salvation. That is all we need to know; trusting in that fact, we can avoid the paralysis of fear when confronting our sick culture. Jesus confronted his sick culture also, in a teachable, non-threatening way. He dwells within us by the power of the Holy Spirit; all we need do is try to imitate his gentleness and courage, challenging and encouraging those we meet to reach for higher values.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>Apostolic succession began when the Risen Jesus imparted his power of sanctifying to the Apostles, who in turn entrusted that power to their successors, the bishops (CCC #1087).

And he assured the people of Alaska and the people of the whole United States that, even when he was far away from their shores, he would \"forget them not.\"\n\nWe must wait until the resurrection of the dead before all human beings will once more be able to speak to each other in the same world-language. Meanwhile, however, whether we are gifted like the pope at learning the tongues of other nations, there is one international language that we can use even now, and that all men understand, because they read it in each other's eyes. It is the language that shy little Mollie Marie spoke when she handed the forget-me-nots to the Holy Father. It is the language of love.\n\n\\-Father Robert F. McNamara\n\n---\n\n**Q475: How can we learn to appreciate the overwhelming Pentecost event and apply it to our daily lives?**\n\nThis is one of those Sundays where a person tends to hear the readings and look “out there,” not realizing that the message is also meant “in here” for us today. We can’t seem to get our arms around such awesome happenings, things like “tongues of fire” on everyone present, Jesus’ surprise appearance through locked doors, and then a “now it’s your turn” mandate to carry on his mission.\n\nAnytime we are reading about or experiencing supernatural events, we find ourselves in the presence of “mystery.” It is not for us to understand the “how”; rather, it is for us to believe that all of this fits into God’s plan of salvation. That means that we simply Trust him, listen to him, and follow his commands.\n\nJohn’s gospel (Jn 20:19-23) packs a powerful punch in only a few words. We could paraphrase them like this: “I give you Peace; I give you the Holy Spirit; I send you to do my work; You will be forgiving and compassionate like me.” All of that sounds like a “graduation” speech for a small bunch of folks behind locked doors, probably scared out of their wits that they might receive the same treatment as Jesus, and not knowing what to do next.\n\nThe beauty of Pentecost is the reminder that we have the Holy Spirit within us, as a very precious gift of God. Baptism and Confirmation empower us with a fullness of the Spirit that is sufficient to carry out our part in God’s plan of salvation. That is all we need to know; trusting in that fact, we can avoid the paralysis of fear when confronting our sick culture. Jesus confronted his sick culture also, in a teachable, non-threatening way. He dwells within us by the power of the Holy Spirit; all we need do is try to imitate his gentleness and courage, challenging and encouraging those we meet to reach for higher values.\n\n**KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!** Apostolic succession began when the Risen Jesus imparted his power of sanctifying to the Apostles, who in turn entrusted that power to their successors, the bishops (CCC #1087). The Sacrament of Confirmation in a certain way perpetuates the grace of Pentecost in the Church (CCC #1288).\n\n---\n\n**Come Holy Spirit**\n\nThe Book of Acts uses the Old Testament images of God's presence -- fire and wind -- to depict the coming of the Holy Spirit as he comes to enable the church to begin its mission of proclaiming the gospel to all nations. The gift of tongues tells us that the coming of the Spirit reverses the confusion and division that came upon the earth at the time of the Tower of Babel. However, as St. Paul tells us, it is easy to be so taken up with the dramatic and spectacular gifts of the Spirit, like the gift of tongues, that we may forget the reason for these gifts. These gifts of the Spirit are not given for our personal enjoyment or prestige, but for the common good of the church, to build up the body of Christ. In today's Gospel Jesus gives the Spirit and the power to forgive sins so that the church may fulfill it mission of reconciliation -- \"to reconcile all things in Christ.\" Whatever gifts we have been given, no matter how spectacular or commonplace they may be, they are given to be used for others.\n\n_Come Holy Spirit, give us the wisdom to recognize the gifts you have given us. Inspire us to so use those gifts in harmony with others that we may more truly become the one Body of Christ_.",

About 300 AD there arose in Alexandria, Egypt, a priest named Arius, who began to teach that Jesus, though the Word made flesh, was not equal to the Father, not God, but like us a creature, though, of course, the highest of all God&apos;s creatures. Now Arius was no fool. He had a brilliant mind and presented &quot;proofs&quot; that at first seemed pretty convincing. As a result, a great turmoil arose in the Christian centers of both East and West. The Roman emperors and other rulers took sides in the dispute and &quot;Arianism&quot; which labeled Christ as just a man, caused trouble right up into the middle ages.</p>\n<p>From the beginning of the squabble, however, the majority of Christian bishops and scholars knew that Arius was wrong. It was only a case of proving he was wrong on the basis of Scripture and Tradition. The first ecumenical council, held in 325 AD at Nicaea in Asia Minor, expressed the correct doctrine. The bishops having condemned Arius issued the profession of faith (The Creed) we continue to proclaim each Sunday at Mass, where we call Jesus Christ &quot;one in being with the Father.&quot; After that the loyal Catholic bishops especially St. Basil the Great also urged everybody to use as a forceful statement of their faith in the Trinity, the doxology (i.e. &quot;glory-prayer&quot;): &quot;Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.&quot; How often we still use this prayer at Mass or in the rosary without realizing that we are crying out &quot;You&apos;re wrong!&quot; to a man who 16 centuries ago dared to declare the Christ is not truly God! (See Matthew 28:19. Today&apos;s gospel.)</p>\n<p>Editor&apos;s note: Original second paragraph ended before the word &quot;divinity&quot;. If a better word or phrase is known, it should be substituted.</p>\n<p>-Father Robert F. McNamara</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>B219: I believe in God, but I have difficulty understanding the Holy Trinity. Does this mean that I have a weak faith?</strong></p>\n<p>Not at all! We are in the area of &quot;mystery&quot; when we speak about things &quot;divine&quot; because God is on a level far removed from our &quot;human&quot; capabilities of understanding. On the other hand, through his infinite goodness, God has revealed Himself to us in various ways: certainly in the common sense way (e.g., by observing nature); occasionally in the spectacular way (e.g., cosmic events at Fatima such as a &quot;spinning sun&quot; and rain without clouds; or the &quot;burning bush&quot; in Moses&apos; time); and the most important way, through his only son Jesus.</p>\n<p>In Jesus&apos; words as well as his repeated actions of supernatural power (e.g., healings) we come to know the &quot;personalities&quot; of God. Jesus told us, &quot;if you have seen me you have seen the Father.&quot; We speak of the &quot;works of power&quot; as works of the Father; &quot;works of wisdom&quot; as works of the Son; and &quot;works of love&quot; as works of the Holy Spirit. And yet all of these &quot;works&quot; are done by all and are common to all in this &quot;divine Godhead&quot; (Thomas Aquinas&apos; attempt to explain the Trinity). It is indeed a &quot;mystery,&quot; but one which we accept and believe in faith.</p>\n<p>We sometimes &quot;draw a blank&quot; when asked, &quot;When did you last encounter God?&quot; But if we ask, &quot;When were you Christ to someone else,&quot; or &quot;When did someone become Christ for you,&quot; then it begins to dawn on us that the Holy Trinity continues to be revealed daily! God dwells within us, from the moment of our Baptism. Jesus has sent us his Holy Spirit. Now it is our turn to &quot;reveal God to others&quot; by passing on his message of love and salvation (Matt 28:16-20). The Holy Trinity is revealed as a continuing interaction of love!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM! </strong>The revealed truth of the Holy Trinity is the very foundation of our faith, and we express that in the Creed (see the Catechism - the Creed is lodged between CCC #184 and 185). The faith of all Christians rests on the Trinity (CCC #232). We are baptized in the name (not &quot;names&quot;) of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit - the Most Holy Trinity!</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>Q531: Trinity: another enormous mystery. How can I understand it better?</strong></p>\n<p>Here we are, fragile and needy persons, &#x201C;little specks of life&#x201D; on this huge planet called Earth. So what does our creator God do? He &#x201C;limits&#x201D; himself, and becomes one of us! As St. Paul puts it, Jesus &#x201C;emptied himself&#x201D; of his divine glory and power, and became human like us in all things except sin (Philippians 2:7). He &#x201C;comes down&#x201D; from his mighty throne in heaven, and &#x201C;sits down&#x201D; with his little children, teaching us his truths. Who sent him? Our heavenly Father, who loves all his children and calls us to holiness, to imitate Jesus.</p>\n<p>True love always involves others. It is a relationship that almost &#x201C;demands&#x201D; three people! For example, my wife Patricia and I love each other deeply. And that love between us produced still more love, as children were born to us from our shared love relationship. Love is never selfish, but is giving, cooperative and creative.</p>\n<p>As St. John would say, we can only love because God first loved us! So in that love relationship between our Heavenly Father and His only begotten Son, we find Love Itself: the Holy Spirit. As our Creed says, the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son; love produces love. This very same Holy Spirit empowers us at our baptism and confirmation to carry out the will of the Father &#x2013; to make known his love for his children, and his desire for their eternal salvation.</p>\n<p>In our Liturgy we hear stories about how God&#x2019;s people struggled to be faithful to the Covenant with God. It is our story! So we need to approach the altar at communion time with great humility &#x2013; our God desires to give himself to us in still another special way, the gifts of consecrated bread and wine, his very Body and Blood! This is Love! This is Trinity!</p>\n<p><strong>KNOW YOUR CATECHISM!</strong> The mystery of the Trinity in itself is inaccessible to the human mind, and is the object of faith only because it was revealed by Jesus Christ, the divine Son of the eternal Father. The faith of all Christians rests on the Trinity (CCC #232, 237, and especially 253-56).</p>\n<p>====</p>\n<p><strong>In His Own Image He Created Them</strong></p>\n<p>Today&apos;s feast celebrates the doctrine that makes Christianity different from all other religions: the Trinity. Reason can lead us to know that God is one, but only divine revelation can tell us of God&apos;s inner nature. Exodus reveals God as slow to anger, merciful and loving, but making demands on us. John&apos;s Gospel shows us a Jesus who as Son of God is loving but still makes demands on us. St. Paul ties it together when he urges the Corinthians and us to mend our ways and experience God as Trinity, calling down on us &quot;the grace of Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.&quot;</p>\n<p>To know God as Trinity is to believe that in God there is community. God is love and love by its very nature requires giving and receiving. If God is love, there must be community of persons who give and receive love among themselves. For us to believe in the Trinity it is not enough to accept the doctrine in the mind. We must live as the image of God giving to and receiving from others in love.</p>\n<p><em>Lord God our Father, Lord Jesus our Redeemer, send forth on us your Holy Spirit that we may learn to live together here on earth according to your divine example.

In those hours of strain, however, she was thinking less of herself than her stepson, Leo, whom she had raised from boyhood. A Catholic man of sixty, he had recently got divorced and entered a civil marriage. Ellen knew that she was living on borrowed time, but if Leo could only be reconciled to the Church, she would die happy.</p>\n<p>This was her anxious prayer, but her petitions and sacrifices had not yet brought about his change of heart. But one day, she took her priest into her confidence. Something encouraging had happened. Now, Ellen was no &quot;visionary&quot; but a practical and able mother and housewife. Nevertheless, she had lately had a dream, she told him, that had deeply consoled her.</p>\n<p>&quot;I dreamt I was lying here,&quot; she said, &quot;when suddenly the door opened and a little boy came in and stood beside me. He had rings of golden hair and was so beautiful I couldn&apos;t resist him. So I leaned over and took him up on the bed and hugged him. As I did so, he said one word: `Hope!&apos; Then the dream ended.&quot;</p>\n<p>After that heartening experience, Ellen renewed the vigor of her prayers. When she died a few years later at the age of 89, Leo had not yet come around. But she had passed away confident.

Thus if the Holy Spirit dwells within us, the entire Holy Trinity is present.

In those hours of strain, however, she was thinking less of herself than her stepson, Leo, whom she had raised from boyhood. A Catholic man of sixty, he had recently got divorced and entered a civil marriage. Ellen knew that she was living on borrowed time, but if Leo could only be reconciled to the Church, she would die happy.\n\nThis was her anxious prayer, but her petitions and sacrifices had not yet brought about his change of heart. But one day, she took her priest into her confidence. Something encouraging had happened. Now, Ellen was no \"visionary\" but a practical and able mother and housewife. Nevertheless, she had lately had a dream, she told him, that had deeply consoled her.\n\n\"I dreamt I was lying here,\" she said, \"when suddenly the door opened and a little boy came in and stood beside me. He had rings of golden hair and was so beautiful I couldn't resist him. So I leaned over and took him up on the bed and hugged him. As I did so, he said one word: \\`Hope!' Then the dream ended.\"\n\nAfter that heartening experience, Ellen renewed the vigor of her prayers. When she died a few years later at the age of 89, Leo had not yet come around. But she had passed away confident. Not long after her death, her stepson did return to the sacraments.\n\nThis true story fits in well with the second reading of today's Mass for Trinity Sunday. Here St. Paul reminds us that \"affliction makes for endurance and endurance for tested virtue and tested virtue for hope.\" The peace of heart that makes us always hopeful is the special loving gift, not of the Holy Spirit alone but of the whole Blessed Trinity.
